Legacy reporting projects created with Stonefield Query Enterprise Studio have a different project structure, so they must be imported into Horizon Reports. 

If you use the Horizon Reports installer to update a previous Stonefield Query Enterprise installation, any existing project will be imported automatically the first time you start Horizon Reports. To import additional projects, you can click the *Import* menu item in the Projects menu.

The Import Project dialog that appears allows you to browse your local filesystem. To import a project, you must locate the primary settings file (settings.xml) for the project. Once you do, select it and click the *Import* button.
