The Project menu has functions for [creating a new project](vfps://Topic/_0QM0X4CH6), [importing a project](vfps://Topic/_0QM0X4CH6), or [managing existing projects](vfps://Topic/_0QM0X4CH6). Additional buttons on the toolbar allow access to various project editors, including:

* *[Data Groups](vfps://Topic/_1O90ZE2TD)*: Here you can define data groups, which allow you to segregate your tables into specific groups or modules.

* *[Roles](vfps://Topic/_1O90ZEBQ4)*: Here you can define roles for use in role-based security.

* *[Configuration]({% link _docs/studio/configuration/configuration-settings.md %})*: Here you can modify customization settings for the reporting project.
