Horizon Reports provides role-based security at the data dictionary level. You can define which roles can access certain tables and fields in the properties pane for table and field objects. Before you do so, however, you must create the roles.

To add a role, choose the *Roles* button on the toolbar, then click the Add button (![](images\addbutton.png)).

After creating a new role, enter the name. Since these names are only used internally in the report writer and not for queries against the database, you don't have to worry about delimiters for names containing spaces or other characters. You are not allowed to leave the name blank or enter a duplicate name.
