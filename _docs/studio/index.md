Horizon Reports Studio is the tool a software developer or consultant uses to create a customized report writer for a particular application's data.

Running Horizon Reports Studio is easy: just double-click the Horizon Reports icon on your Windows desktop. If it's the first time you're launching Horizon Reports, you'll be prompted to create a new reporting project. If you've already used Horizon Reports Studio to create a reporting project, you'll be automatically redirected to the report writer after you log in. 

From the report writer, you can navigate back to Studio using the "Studio" button in the upper right.
