When you run Horizon Reports for the first time, a 30 day demo period begins. After 30 days, Horizon Reports will stop working and prompt for a license to be activated. If that happens and you still need time to evaluate Horizon Reports, contact <a href="mailto:sales@horizon-reports.com">sales@horizon-reports.com</a> to request an extension code to extend your trial period.

When you purchase Horizon Reports, you can activate the program. There's nothing new to install and all of the reporting projects and reports you created are still available. See the [Activating Horizon Reports]({% link _docs/how-to/activating.md %}) topic for details.
