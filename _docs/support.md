If you need technical assistance, create a support ticket in the Support Center. To do so, navigate your browser to <a href="https://www.horizon-reports.com/helpdesk/" target="top">https://www.horizon-reports.com/helpdesk</a> and add a new ticket with a description of the problem.

Note that your [software maintenance](vfps://Topic/_24B0X7B2S) must be current in order to receive technical support. Also note that services such as assisting with data dictionary setup, plugins, or report design and layout are not technical support but rather consulting. Please contact us for our consulting rates if you are interested in these services.
