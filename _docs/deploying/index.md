There are three steps involved in deploying a Horizon Reports project to your end-users. The first is [creating customized help]({% link _docs/deploying/creating-help.md %}) for your project. The second is [installing Horizon Reports]({% link _docs/deploying/publishing.md %}) on the server. The third is setting up the Horizon Reports web application on a [web server]({% link _docs/deploying/configuring-iis/index.md %}).

In addition, you may wish to provide some sample or standard [reports]({% link _docs/deploying/samplereports.md %}) or [templates]({% link _docs/deploying/sampletemplates.md %}) to your users. The topics under this section describe how to do these steps.
