The end user Report Writer has a HTML-based help (similar to this site) that describes all the functionality and provides a "how to" section. By default, the report writer will link to http://docs.horizon-reports.com for help. You can also create a customized help site. This allows you to  make changes to the [Application Name](vfps://Topic/_0OW0UC6M0) or other [configuration settings](vfps://Topic/_0OW0UA8BF). 

## Creating customized help
To create customized help for your Horizon Reports project, do the following:

* Clone Git

* Edit Yaml

* Set up Pages

## Further customizing help
You may want to consider customizing the following:

* Add any additional information desired to the Technical Support topic under.

* If you create a [Setup plugin](vfps://Topic/_3QV0S1XDP), add a topic under the Configuration section describing any additional options you defined in the plugin.

Edit the markdown (.md) files for the appropriate help topics using your favorite text editor.
