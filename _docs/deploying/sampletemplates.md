Horizon Reports comes with a number of stock templates in the Templates folder. If you want to distribute customized templates to your users, copy the SQT files into the Project_Data\StockTemplates folder (create this folder if necessary). When you [publish](vfps://Topic/_3X60MKZKD) your project, these templates are automatically imported the next time the site is launched. If you make any changes to the SQT files in the StockTemplates folder, such as if you update a template and copy the SQT file to that folder, changes are propagated automatically.
