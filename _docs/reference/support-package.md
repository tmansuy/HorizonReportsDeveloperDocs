{{ site.app_name }} logs many of the things it does as it starts, the user logs in, runs a report, and so on. This information is logged to a file named AppLog.txt in the Logs folder. This log doesn't contain useful information for the average user but it is very useful to {{ site.company }} support staff, who can analyze it to track down problems.

To download the log so you can send it to us, choose the Download Application Log function from the Tools menu. Note that this function is only available to users in the Administrator role.

A similar function, Download Support Package, downloads not only the log file, but other information useful for diagnostic purposes.
