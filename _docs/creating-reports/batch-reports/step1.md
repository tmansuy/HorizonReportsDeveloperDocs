* *Name*: the name of the report. Although you can go to another next step without entering a valid name, you cannot click Finish to save the report.

* *Comments*: any comments entered here appear in the Information window for the report in the [Reports Explorer]({% link _docs/creating-reports/reports-explorer.md %}). You can expand the text area for entering comments by dragging the handle in the lower-right corner of the area.

* *Tags*: the tags for the report. Click in the Tags area to display a drop-down list of tag names. Select one from the list to add that tag to the report. To remove a tag, click the "x" to the left of its name. You can add as many tags as you wish to a report.
