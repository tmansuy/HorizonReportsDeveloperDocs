A list containing reports appears at the left. The reports are organized by the same tags they are in the Reports Explorer. To hide or show the reports for a tag, click the tag bar.

A list showing the reports included in the batch appears at the right. To add a report to the list, click the ![](/assets/images/add.png) button beside the report name in the *Available reports* list. To remove a report from the *Selected reports* list, click the ![](/assets/images/deleteicon.png) button. If a report that has been included in the batch has ask-at-runtime filter conditions, the *Set filter values* button allows you to set values to pass to these conditions when the batch report is run.
