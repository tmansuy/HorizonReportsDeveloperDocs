A batch report is a set of reports that should be combined into a single output file. The supported output types for a batch report are PDF, CSV, TXT, and XLSX. A batch report can't be previewed as a standalone report, but it can be used in a scheduled task to generate a single output file from multiple reports.

To create a batch report, choose Batch Report from the New menu.

There are four steps in the Batch Report Wizard:

* *[Step 1: Information]({% link _docs/creating-reports/batch-reports/step1.md %})*: specify the report name, comments, and tags.

* *[Step 2: Report Selection]({% link _docs/creating-reports/batch-reports/step2.md %})*: choose the reports to be included in this batch report.

* *[Step 3: Export Options]({% link _docs/creating-reports/batch-reports/step3.md %})*: set export options for this batch report.

* *[Step 4: Security]({% link _docs/creating-reports/batch-reports/step4.md %})*: select which roles can access the report.

To move from one step to another in the wizard, click the next or previous buttons or choose a specific step number from the toolbar at the bottom.

The bottom right of the wizard has buttons to cancel editing the report or finish and save the report.
