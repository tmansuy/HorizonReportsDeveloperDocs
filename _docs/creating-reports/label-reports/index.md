There are six steps in the Label Report Wizard:

* *[Step 1: Information]({% link _docs/creating-reports/label-reports/step1.md %})*: specify the report name, comments, and tags.

* *[Step 2: Data Selection]({% link _docs/creating-reports/label-reports/step2.md %})*: choose the fields for the report and how they should be formatted.

* *[Step 3: Sorting]({% link _docs/creating-reports/label-reports/step3.md %})*: select how the fields are grouped and sorted.

* *[Step 4: Filtering]({% link _docs/creating-reports/label-reports/step4.md %})*: choose which records to include and exclude.

* *[Step 5: Report Options]({% link _docs/creating-reports/label-reports/step5.md %})*: specify the orientation, template, paper size, margins, and other options.

* *[Step 6: Security]({% link _docs/creating-reports/label-reports/step6.md %})*: select which roles can access the report.

To move from one step to another in the wizard, click the next or previous buttons or choose a specific step number from the toolbar at the bottom.

The bottom right of the wizard has buttons to preview the report, cancel editing the report, or finish and save the report. You can [preview]({% link _docs/creating-reports/previewing.md %}) your report any time after you have selected at least one field in the report. This is handy, since you can change something in the report, preview it to see how it looks, change it, preview again, and so on.
