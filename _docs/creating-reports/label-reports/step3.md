Step 3 lets you choose the order in which records appear in the report. For example, you may wish to have the labels sorted by country and within country by company name.

The *Normal fields* list displays the fields in the report you haven't sorted on. To sort on a field, drag it from this list to the *Sorted fields* list. You can specify whether the sort is in ascending (from lowest to highest) or descending (highest to lowest) order by clicking the appropriate button: ![](/assets/images/sortasc.png) or ![](/assets/images/sortdesc.png). You can have as many sorted fields as you want.

To remove a field from the sort, drag it back to *Normal fields*.
