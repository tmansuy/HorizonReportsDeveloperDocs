The second step is creating a reporting project. A reporting project is a set of configuration files that tell Horizon Reports how it works with your data. When you launch Horizon Reports for the first time, you'll automatically be prompted to create a project. Alternately, you can use the *New* menu item under the Project menu in Horizon Reports Studio. See the [Creating a New Project](vfps://Topic/_0QM0UUQPM) topic for details.

Horizon Reports will scan your data and create a reporting project, and then you're then ready for [Step 3](vfps://Topic/_0OY0Q5CKK).
