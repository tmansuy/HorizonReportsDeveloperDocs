After customizing the project and filling in configuration settings, it's time to test. Click the "Report Writer" button in the top right corner to launch the report writer with your project.

If this is the first time logging in to the report writer, use the default user name "admin" and the default password "admin". Make sure to change the default administrator password in the security dialog after logging in for the first time.
