You can create a private labeled or branded version of Horizon Reports by changing a number of [configuration settings](vfps://Topic/_0OW0UA8BF) (those in the Branding section). This allows you to distribute the report writer as your own branded product, so your end-users won't know it's Horizon Reports from TNM Software; they'll think it's something you've created just for them. This also allows you to sell your branded version for whatever price fits your business model.
