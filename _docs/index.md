{{ site.app_name }} from {{ site.company }} is a powerful query builder and report writer. In addition to running pre-defined reports, you can create your own reports in just minutes. Simply select which fields to report on from the list of available fields (with meaningful descriptive names rather than cryptic "database" names), and you're done! You don't have to know complex stuff like joins; {{ site.app_name }} takes care of that for you.

For finer control, you can customize how each field appears, including column heading, grouping, sorting, and totaling. The easy-to-use filter dialog allows you to include or exclude specific records. Finally, save the report so you can edit it, copy it, or make it available to others to run.
