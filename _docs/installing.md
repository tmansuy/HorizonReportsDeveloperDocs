Installing Horizon Reports is much like installing any other application. Note that Horizon Reports needs Microsoft .NET 6 Hosting Bundle, so if that isn't already installed on your system, it'll be downloaded and installed as part of the Horizon Reports. If IIS is installed, the hosting bundle will add IIS specific components. Otherwise, you can ignore IIS related messages while installing the Hosting Bundle.
