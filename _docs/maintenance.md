Horizon Reports updates and technical support are only available for customers with current software maintenance. When you first purchase Horizon Reports, you receive one year of software maintenance. After that period, you can renew your software maintenance for an additional year. During the software maintenance period, you're eligible to install any updates released during that period. In addition, during this period, you can access the <a href="https://www.horizon-reports.com/helpdesk/" target="top">support ticket system</a> for technical support. If your software maintenance lapses, you can no longer install updated versions and are not eligible for technical support until you renew your software maintenance. The About dialog displays the software maintenance expiry date.
