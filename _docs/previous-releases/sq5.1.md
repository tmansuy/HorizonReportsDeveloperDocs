# New Features

* Added the ability to set a license limit on a per Tenant basis. For example, if a Tenant has a license limit of 2, then only 2 users from that Tenant will be able to log in concurrently.

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue with running the site from a virtual directory.

* Fixed an issue where publishing a project would occasionally not complete properly.
