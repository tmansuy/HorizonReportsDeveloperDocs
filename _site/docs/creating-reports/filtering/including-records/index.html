Selecting a subset of records to work with is called <em>filtering</em>. The Filtering page of the report wizards allows you to specify which records are included in the report.</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/filter.png" alt="" /></p> <p>This page has the following options:</p> <ul> <li> <p><em>Filter conditions</em>: this section has filter conditions that determine which records to include in the report.</p> </li> <li> <p><em>Exclude conditions</em>: this section has filter conditions that determine which records to exclude in the report.</p> </li> <li> <p><em>Fields</em>: this drop-down list allows you to determine which fields are displayed when creating a filter condition. <em>Show all fields</em> means display all fields whether they are included in the report or not, <em>Show selected fields only</em> means display only those fields in the <em>Selected Fields</em> list for the report, and <em>Show selected tables only</em> means display only those tables being used in the report.</p> </li> </ul> <h1 id="creating-a-filter"> <a href="#creating-a-filter" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="creating-a-filter"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Creating a Filter </h1> <p>A filter is made up of one or more <em>conditions</em>. A single condition compares a field to a value. For example, “Order Amount is greater than $100.00” is a condition that only allows those records with an order amount of more than $100.00 to appear in the report.</p> <p>A condition is made up of either three or four parts, depending on whether it’s the first condition in a filter or not: the field to filter on (for example, Order Amount), the operator, the value or values, and the connection.</p> <h2 id="operator"> <a href="#operator" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="operator"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Operator </h2> <p>How the field is compared to the value is called the <em>operator</em>. There are several operators available; they are shown in the table below. Some operators use more than one value; for example, <em>is between</em> requires two values (as in “Order Date is between 01/10/96 and 12/31/96”). Other operators do not use any value; for example, “Zip code is blank” is either true or not without needing a value.</p> <div class="table-wrapper"><table class="detailtable table-striped"> <tr> <th>Operator</th><th>Description</th> </tr> <tr> <td>equals</td><td><p>The data stored in the field must exactly match the value you specify.</p> <p>Example: Last Name equals Johns</p> <p>The report shows only records with "Johns" as the last name.

The connection can be either <em>AND</em> or <em>OR</em>. The AND connection means the two conditions it connects must both be true for a record to be included in the report, while the OR connection means that either one or both can be true for a record to be included.</p> <p>You can think of AND as “more restrictive.” For example, if the first condition is “City equals San Francisco,” that gives a certain set of records. Adding a second condition such as “Order Amount is greater than 100.00” using the AND connection means that for any given record, the city must be San Francisco and the order amount must be greater than $100.00. Since that excludes San Francisco records with an order amount of less than $100.00 (which just specifying the first condition includes), these two conditions together are more restrictive (there are fewer records in the report) than either of these conditions alone.</p> <p>You can think of OR as “less restrictive.” For example, if the first condition is “City equals San Francisco” and you add a second condition such as “City equals Los Angeles” using the OR connection, this means that for any given record, the city can either be San Francisco or Los Angeles. These two conditions together are less restrictive than either of these conditions alone, since the report includes records matching both conditions.</p> <p>Notice the use of AND and OR with filters can be the opposite of how these words are used in English. For example, someone might say “print out all of our customers from San Francisco and Los Angeles.” You might think you use the AND connection in this case, but in fact you use the OR connection since you want records where the city is either San Francisco or Los Angeles. The way to think of it is this: for each record, check each condition. It is not possible, for example, for the city for any one record to be both San Francisco and Los Angeles at the same time. It could be either one, however, so OR is the correct connection to use.</p> <p>Watch out if you need to use both AND and OR connections in a filter. Conditions connected with AND are evaluated before those connected with OR. For example, if you want all customers from San Francisco or Los Angeles where the sales amount is more than $50, you might think you could use “City equals San Francisco or City equals Los Angeles and Sales is greater than 50.” However, this likely won’t give you the results you want because the AND is evaluated first. So, this gives all customers from Los Angeles where the sales amount is more than $50 (the second and third conditions ANDed) or those from San Francisco regardless of the sales amount (the first condition).</p> <p>If you need to use both AND and OR connections in a filter, you need to use <em>filter groups</em>. All the conditions in a filter group use the same connection. Filter groups are connected together using another connection. So, to get all customers from San Francisco or Los Angeles where the sales amount is more than $50, use one filter group of “City equals San Francisco or City equals Los Angeles” and another of “Sales is greater than 50.” The two groups are connected using AND. Internally, the filter condition is handled with parentheses: “(City equals San Francisco or City equals Los Angeles) and Sales is greater than 50.” However, filter groups make it easier to understand how the conditions are combined than worrying about where parentheses should go and how many there are.</p> <h1 id="the-filter-page"> <a href="#the-filter-page" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="the-filter-page"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> The Filter Page </h1> <p>The Filter page of the report wizards allows you to see the conditions that make up the filter, add new conditions, and edit or remove conditions.</p> <h2 id="adding-a-filter-condition"> <a href="#adding-a-filter-condition" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="adding-a-filter-condition"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Adding a filter condition </h2> <p>To add a new condition to the filter, click the left <img src="/assets/images/add.png" alt="" /> button. The new condition appears within the filter group you clicked the button for. The condition’s bar shows the settings for the condition: the field name, the operator, and the values.</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/filtercondition.png" alt="" /></p> <p>If you already have at least one condition in the filter group, the Filter Condition dialog appears a little differently.</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/filtercondition_with_connection.png" alt="" /></p> <p>The connection button, which does not appear if this is the first condition for your filter group, is used to define how this condition is connected to the previous condition in your filter. The default connection is <em>and</em>, but you can also choose <em>or</em> by clicking the button. See the <a href="vfps://Topic/_0380PFG23">Creating a Filter</a> topic for a discussion of how connections work. The black brace shows which conditions are connected with a particular connection.</p> <p>The table drop-down list shows the tables you can select fields from. The field drop-down list shows the fields you can filter on from the selected table. The <em>Fields</em> drop-down list allows you to determine which fields are displayed when creating a filter condition. <em>Show all fields</em> means display all fields whether they are included in the report or not, <em>Show selected fields</em> only means display only those fields in the Selected Fields list for the report, and <em>Show selected tables</em> only means display only those tables being used in the report.</p> <p>After selecting a field, select a comparison operator from the operator drop-down list. The options that appear in this list depend on the type of field selected. For example, for Boolean (true or false or yes or no) fields, the only choices that appear are <em>is Yes</em> and <em>is No</em>. See the <a href="vfps://Topic/_0380PFG23">Creating a Filter</a> topic for a discussion of how operators work.</p> <p>Once you’ve selected an operator, you may enter a value to compare to the field. You won’t be allowed to enter a value if you choose the <em>is blank</em>, <em>is not blank</em>, <em>is Yes</em>, or <em>is No</em> operators. If you choose the <em>is between</em> or <em>is not between</em> operators, you must enter two values. If you choose the <em>is one of</em> or <em>is not one of</em> operators, you can enter up to ten different values.</p> <p>When you start typing a value, Horizon Reports checks whether there are any values in the field the filter condition is for that start with what you’ve typed. If so, it displays the choices in a drop-down list. For example, if your database contains cities named San Cristóbal and San Francisco, you’ll see the following when you type “San”:</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/filtertypeahead.png" alt="" /></p> <p>If you’re not sure what values appear in the field or want to select a value without having to type it, click the <img src="/assets/images/valuesicon.png" alt="" /> button. A list of unique values from the field appears in the Field Values dialog. You can choose a single value or multiple values; to select more than one value, hold down the Ctrl key as you click the desired values. If you choose more than one, the operator is automatically changed to <em>is one of</em>.</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/getvalue.png" alt="" /></p> <p>If you select a date field, type the desired date in the format YYYY-MM-DD (or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS if <em>Use date only</em> is turned off), where YYYY is the year, MM is the month number, DD is the day number, HH is the hours, MM is the minutes, and SS is the seconds; for example, January 4, 2014 is 2014-01-04. To display the date without the time, turn on <em>Use date only</em>. Instead of typing the date, you can click the <img src="/assets/images/calendaricon.png" alt="" /> button at the right of the text box to display a calendar. When the calendar is displayed, you can select a date by simply clicking it. Click the left or right arrows to move to the previous or next month.</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/calendarday.png" alt="" /></p> <p>Click the month at the top of the calendar to display a list of months in the selected year you can select from. Clicking a month moves the calendar to that month. Click the left or right arrows to move to the previous or next year.</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/calendarmonth.png" alt="" /></p> <p>Click the year at the top of the calendar to display a list of years in the selected decade. Clicking a year displays the months for that year. Click the left or right arrows to move to the previous or next decade.</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/calendaryear.png" alt="" /></p> <p>If <em>Use date only</em> is turned off, the bottom of the calendar has a <img src="/assets/images/clockicon.png" alt="" /> button. Click this button to display the time with up and down buttons to make it easy to change the hours and minutes.</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/calendarclock.png" alt="" /></p> <p>If you want to be <a href="vfps://Topic/_28G0Z1YRI">prompted</a> to enter the values when you run the report, turn on the <em>Ask at runtime</em> option.</p> <p>To compare a field to another field rather than a value, select <em>Field</em> from the <em>Compare to</em> option (the default is Value, which means a value is used). Select the field to compare against in the drop-down list that appears in place of the value text box. Note that this only allows you to select fields from the same table and the same data type as the field you’re filtering on; for example, if you choose a date field, only date fields from the same table appear in the list. Also note that <em>Compare to</em> isn’t available if you choose the <em>is blank</em>, <em>is not blank</em>, <em>is Yes</em>, <em>is No</em>, <em>is one of</em>, or <em>is not one of</em> operators. To compare a field in one table to a field in another table, use a database expression (described next) and specify the name of the field in the other table as the expression.</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/comparetofield.png" alt="" /></p> <p>To compare a field to an expression, select either <em>Database Expression</em> or <em>Expression</em> from the <em>Compare to</em> option. The difference between the two is that <em>Database Expression</em> is an expression the database engine evaluates and <em>Expression</em> is an expression that Horizon Reports evaluates. Typically, you’ll use <em>Database Expression</em> to specify a field or a function that you know the database engine can evaluate and you’ll use <em>Expression</em> for any other type of expression.</p> <p>Enter the expression into the text box. For example, to look for all records with a date field falling in the last week, use the “is between” operator and AddDays(Now(), -7) for the first expression and Now() for the second expression. Since Now() gives today’s date and AddDays() adds the specified number of days to a date, AddDays(Now(), -7) is seven days ago, so this gives all records with the date being between one week ago and today. The <a href="vfps://Topic/_16W0VJB34">Expressions and Functions Reference</a> topic has a list of the most useful functions.</p> <p>Note that the “is one of” and “is not one of” operators are only available if <em>Compare to</em> is set to <em>Value</em>.</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/comparetoexpression.png" alt="" /></p> <p>By default, filter conditions are displayed in the header of the report. If you don’t want a particular condition to be displayed, turn off the <em>Display in report header</em> setting. This is useful for reports that have a lot of filter conditions, which can get quite long when listed in the report header. You might in that case turn this option off for all but ask-at-runtime conditions.</p> <p>The condition is displayed in the report header as Field Operator Value, such as “City equals San Francisco” or “Active Is Yes.” If you want to customize the description, turn on <em>Custom description</em> and enter the desired description. For example, “Active customers” might be a more meaningful description than “Active Is Yes.” If you want to use an <a href="vfps://Topic/_16W0VJB34">expression</a> rather than fixed text, surround the expression with “{“ and “}” (without the quotes). Note that the expression must evaluate to a string value, so use the Str() function if necessary to convert non-string values such as dates and numbers to their string equivalent.</p> <p>Here’s an example of an expression that displays “Customers in <value>" (such as "Customers in Germany" if Germany is the value chosen for the filter condition) in the report header:</value></p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{"Customers in " + GetConditionValue(1)}
</code></pre></div></div> <p>GetConditionValue is a built-in function that returns the value for the condition as a string; specify “1” for the first value, “2” for the second value, and so on (a condition only has more than one value if the “is between” or “is one of” operators is used).</p> <p>After you’ve finished with the condition, you may wish to click its bar to collapse the condition settings so they don’t take up as much room.</p> <h2 id="adding-a-filter-group"> <a href="#adding-a-filter-group" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="adding-a-filter-group"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Adding a filter group </h2> <p>As discussed in the <a href="vfps://Topic/_0380PFG23">Creating a Filter</a> topic, filter groups are used to group filter conditions that use the same operator. Filter groups are connected together using another connection. So, to get all customers from San Francisco or Los Angeles where the sales amount is more than $50, use one filter group of “City equals San Francisco” connected with OR to “City equals Los Angeles” and another filter group of “Sales is greater than 50.” The two groups are connected using AND.</p> <p>The only complication is the order in which you create conditions and groups. If you know you’ll need at least one filter group, start by creating one by clicking the right-most <img src="/assets/images/add.png" alt="" /> button. Don’t worry if you didn’t realize until later that you needed a group; we’ll show you later how to rearrange conditions into groups.</p> <p>To use the example of customers from San Francisco or Los Angeles where the sales amount is more than $50, do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Click the right-most <img src="/assets/images/add.png" alt="" /> button to create a new filter group.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click the left <img src="/assets/images/add.png" alt="" /> button in the new group to create a filter condition and change the settings for the condition to City equals San Francisco.
