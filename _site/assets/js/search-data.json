Using the Template Editor, you can add a picture object to a template that uses the desired image. Any report using that template then displays that image. However, there’s a little easier way to do this. One of the stock templates, Professional - Blue with Logo, already has a picture object on it. This picture uses whatever image you upload using the Upload a Logo Image function in the Tools menu. So, simply upload a company logo and use that template for your reports. Note that the Upload a Logo Image function is only available for Administrator and Tenant Administrator users. If you want a different template to work the same way, do the following: . | Use the Template Editor to create or edit the desired template . | Add a parameter to the template named LogoImage . | Add a picture object and set the Data Binding Image property to the LogoImage parameter . | .

The options in the General page are: . | Display real table and field names: if you are familiar with the name of your application’s tables and fields, you might find it easier to locate the tables and fields you want by their real names. If you turn this option on, Horizon Reports displays the real name followed by the descriptive name in parentheses. | Report preview opens in new window: if you turn this option on, reports are previewed in a new tab in your browser. With this option off, the Preview window appears inside the same browser tab as the rest of the dialogs. | Use 24 hour time format: turn this option on to display times in 24-hour format, such as 15:25:00 for 3:25 p.m. Turn it off to display times in 12-hour format, such as 3:25 PM. | Default quick report template: this setting determines the default template used for new quick reports. | Default crosstab template: this setting determines the default template used for new cross-tab reports. | Language: this allows you to select which language you want Horizon Reports to display in. | Locale: this setting determines the formatting of numeric and date values. For example, 1400 appears as $1,400.00 when Locale is set to English (United States) and 1.400,00 € when it’s set to Deutsch (Deutschland), while July 4, 1996 appears as 07/04/1996 for English (United States) and 04.07.1996 for Deutsch (Deutschland). | Theme: this option allows you to change the theme of the application, which affects the appearance, including colors and fonts. For example, here’s what the Amelia theme looks like: . | Length units: this setting determines the units for measurements such as field width: inches or centimeters. | . The options in the Email page are used when you want to email a report to someone or if an unexpected error occurs in Horizon Reports, in which case you have an option of emailing an error report to us so we can resolve the problem. The options are: . | Use as default settings for all users: If this option is on, any user that doesn’t have their email settings filled in will use these settings instead to send email. This option is only visible for administrator users. | Name: your email descriptive name, such as “John Doe.” . | Email address: the email address to use as the origin address for the email. | Reply to address: an optional email address in case you want a different reply-to than your main email address. | Mail server address: the address for your mail server. | SMTP port: the port for your SMTP mail server. This defaults to 25, but can be changed if necessary. | Email server requires authentication for outgoing: turn this option on if applicable. | User name: the user name to use if the Email server requires authentication for outgoing option is turned on. | Password: the password to use if the Email server requires authentication for outgoing option is turned on. | Use SSL/TLS: turn this setting on if your email server uses SSL/TLS. | POP connection before SMTP: turn this setting on if your email server requires a POP connection before using SMTP. | POP server address: the address for your POP mail server. This setting only appears if POP connection before SMTP is turned on. | POP port: the port for your POP mail server. This setting only appears if POP connection before SMTP is turned on. | . Click the Test settings button to test that the email settings are correct by sending an email to the address you entered. The Saved Email Addresses page allows you to manage any email addresses that have been saved after being entered in the export options for a report. To remove an email address that has been saved, select it in the list, and then click the button. The Server Settings page is only available for users in the Administrator role. The options are: . | Run schedules under this server/domain account: turn this setting on if you want to specify the credentials (Windows user name and password) for scheduled reports. If these are filled in, the user doesn’t have to specify them when creating a schedule. | Use Active Directory authentication: if your system uses Active Directory and you don’t want to add users to Horizon Reports manually, turn this setting on and specify the domain name. Any Active Directory users in that domain are automatically Horizon Reports users. | Memory limit for split query: this setting allows you to place a limit on the amount of server memory a split query can occupy. In certain circumstances, like if you filter on a formula, it’s necessary to split up the request for report information in to several steps. This process can tie up a large amount of server memory while the report is running. If resources on the server are limited, this option can help prevent problems with other applications running on the server. | . If you require extra security for your user account, you can enable Two-factor authentication on this tab. When this tab is opened initially, the status will be listed as Disabled. To enable Two-factor authentication, click the Enable button, and follow the on-screen instructions that appear. Once enabled, you’ll be prompted to enter a token from your authenticator app each time you log in. To disable Two-factor authentication once it’s enabled, click the Disable button.

In Step 1, specify the name to assign to the schedule, the starting date and time for the schedule, whether the schedule ends or not, and if so, the ending date. Select how often the schedule is run: daily, weekly, monthly, or monthly - day of month. For a daily schedule, choose how many days apart the schedule runs, such as every 2 days, whether the schedule should repeat, and if so after how many minutes it should repeat.

A report consists of, at a minimum, TopMargin, Detail, and BottomMargin bands; these bands cannot be deleted. In addition, Horizon Reports creates a ReportFooter band to hold report totals, although you can remove this band if you wish, and there is one GroupHeader and possibly a GroupFooter band per grouped field. A bar showing the band name appears at the left of the Layout Area for a band. The space to the right of the bar is for the objects in that band. Click the box for a band to select the band. Click it a second time to collapse it or again to expand it. To resize a band, position your mouse pointer at the bottom of the band’s box and drag up or down. You can also change the height by editing the Height property in the Properties Panel. You cannot make a band smaller than the bottom of the lowest object in the band. To add a band to the report, select a band or the report in the objects list in the Properties Panel or click one of the existing bands in the Layout Area, then click the appropriate button in the Action secion of the Properties Panel, such as to add a ReportHeaderBand.

Click the down arrow to display a color picker window you can use to choose the color. | Font properties have the following sub-properties: . | Font Name: the font name to use. Choose the desired font from the drop-down list. | Size: the font size in the units specified in the Unit property. | Unit: the units for the Size property. The default is Point. | . In addition, the Bold, Italic, Underline, and Strikeout buttons indicate the appropriate setting. | Dimension properties, such as Location, Padding, and Size, are measured in the units specified by the Measure Unit property of the report. The default is hundredths of an inch. | A format string property, usually called Format String, specifies how a value should be formatted. The format string is typically something like “{0:format},” where format is a set of symbols. Commonly used format symbols are: . | Symbol | Description | . | cn | Displays the value using the currency settings based on the Locale setting (for example, \"$\" as the currency symbol, \",\" as the thousands separator, and \".\" as the decimal separator in North America) and the number of decimal places specified as n. For example, 4132 formatted as c2 displays as $4,132.00 in North America and &#128;4.132,00 in Germany. | . | 0 | A place holder for a digit, padded with a zero if necessary. For example, 4132 formatted as 000000 displays as 004132. | . | # | A place holder for a digit, blank if necessary. For example, 4132 formatted as #####0 displays as 4132. | . | , | Displays the thousands separator symbol based on the Locale setting (for example, \",\" in North America). You only have to specify the character once, not once every three places. For example, 4132 formatted as #,##0 displays as 4,132 in North America and 4.132 in Germany. | . | . | Displays a decimal separator symbol based on the Locale setting (for example, \".\" in North America).

For example, 0.132 formatted as ##0.00% displays as 13.20%. | . | d | Displays a date/time value using the Short Date setting based on the Locale setting. For example, January 10, 2013 2:22:30 PM displays as 1/10/2013 in the U.S. and 10/01/2013 in France. | . | D | Displays a date/time value using the Long Date setting based on the Locale setting. For example, January 10, 2013 2:22:30 PM displays as Thursday, January 10, 2013 in the U.S. | . | g | Displays a date/time value using the Short Date setting based on the Locale setting, including the time without seconds. For example, January 10, 2013 2:22:30 PM displays as 1/10/2013 2:22 PM in the U.S. | . | G | Displays a date/time value using the Short Date setting based on the Locale setting, including the time with seconds. For example, January 10, 2013 2:22:30 PM displays as 1/10/2013 2:22:30 PM in the U.S. | . | t | Displays a date/time value using the Short Time setting based on the Locale setting. For example, January 10, 2013 2:22:30 PM displays as 2:22 PM in the U.S. | . | T | Displays a date/time value using the Long Time setting based on the Locale setting.

This is often used to give those objects a common background color, such as these column headings enclosed within a panel with a dark grey background: . There are no specific properties for Panels. | Table: a table displays data in a spreadsheet-like format. Tables aren’t used much in Horizon Reports except in cross-tab reports. | Line: draws a line on the report. | Shape: draws a shape on the report, such as a rectangle, ellipse, arrow, bracket, and so on. | Bar Code: displays the data for a field as one of several types of bar codes. | Zip Code: displays the data for a field graphically as a U.S. zip code. | Chart: charts the data as a pie chart, line graph, column chart, and so on. Adding a Chart to a report in the Advanced Report Designer doesn’t work well because the result set likely isn’t set up for it. | Sparkline): displays a very small line chart, showing the general shape of the variation in some value. | Pivot Grid: this object is similar to a PivotTable in Microsoft Excel, showing data with variables in the rows and columns. Horizon Reports doesn’t use this for cross-tab reports because they don’t paginate very well. Adding a Pivot Grid to a report in the Advanced Report Designer doesn’t work well because the result set likely isn’t set up for it. Instead, create a cross-tab report. | Subreport: this includes another report within the report. Subreports are how Horizon Reports displays linked reports as drilldowns or embedded reports. Adding a Subreport to a report in the Advanced Report Designer doesn’t work well because there isn’t another report object available. Instead, using the subreport feature to add a subreport to the report. | Page Info: this object is used to show the current date, page number, page count, or “Page X of Y” on a report. | Page Break: used to force a page break. Putting a Page Break in a group header band causes a page break when the group changes. Adding one to the detail band makes every record appear on its own page. There are no specific properties for Page Break objects. | Cross-band Line: like a Line, but this object can span multiple bands. | Cross-band Box: like Cross-band Line, this object can span multiple bands. | .

    "title": "Scripts",
    "content": "Scripts allow you to specify code to execute for specific events during a report run. This can be used to display something different than the actual value of a field, to perform custom summarization, and other tasks. Horizon Reports uses scripts for report linking to tell the Preview window when a subreport should be displayed and what to do when the user clicks a hyperlinked field. Writing scripts requires knowledge of the C#, Visual Basic .NET, or JScript .NET languages so it’s intended for programmers only. All the scripts for a report must be written in the same language; this language is specified in the Script Language report property. To edit the scripts for a report, click the Scripts button () in the Report Designer toolbar. The editor area shows the script code. This is a typical text editor but uses color coding to help with syntax. At the left edge is a strip to display line numbers. Small arrows appear to the right of the line numbers; clicking an arrow collapses or expands a code block. The Control drop-down list in the toolbar lists the objects in the report. The Event drop-down list beside the Control list displays the events for the selected object. Choosing one from the list either creates a script to handle that event or moves the editor to that script if it already exists. The Validate button in the toolbar examines the script code and displays any errors it finds as a red X in beside the line numbers at the left edge of the window. Hover your mouse pointer over the X to see the error message. The scripts for a report are organized like a typical .NET class but without the “class” definition. There may be using statements, fields, properties, and methods. Event handler methods are usually named ObjectName_Event, where ObjectName is the name of the object and Event is the event being handled for that object. If you created a script by selecting an event name from the list at the top, the script is automatically associated with that event for the object. However, you can also do that manually by expanding the Scripts property for an object and choosing the desired handler from the drop-down list for a specific event. Here’s an example where a script is useful: custom summarization. Suppose you want to show the total number of boxes of product units on order, where there are 15 items per box. Add a label to a group footer band of the report and set its data binding to the field containing the units on order. In the Properties Panel, set the Function sub-property of its Summary property to “Custom,” the Format String sub-property to “Total boxes: {0},” and the Running sub-property to “Group.” Expand the label’s Script property and click “…” for the Summary Reset, Summary Row Changed, and Summary Get Result events to create script code for them. Use code like the following for these scripts: . // Declare a summary and a box. double totalUnits = 0; double box = 15; private void xrLabel1_SummaryReset(object sender, EventArgs e) { // Reset the result each time a group is printed. totalUnits = 0; } private void xrLabel1_SummaryRowChanged(object sender, EventArgs e) { // Calculate a summary. totalUnits += Convert.ToDouble( GetCurrentColumnValue(\"UnitsOnOrder\")); } private void xrLabel1_SummaryGetResult(object sender, SummaryGetResultEventArgs e) { // Round the result, so that a pack will be taken // into account even if it contains only one unit. e.Result = Math.Ceiling(totalUnits / box); e.Handled = true; } . The SummaryReset method resets the total number of units to 0 when a group breaks. SummaryRowChanged fires on every record, so it adds the current value of the UnitsOnOrder field to the total. SummaryGetResult is called when the summary value is needed (that is, when the label is about to be printed); it calculates the number of boxes by dividing the total number of units by the units per box.

It also is error-prone; you could forget to set one of the properties for some objects, so they look different than the other objects. It’s also hard to make overall changes, such as changing the font for every object from Arial to Tahoma. Instead, use styles. Like styles in Microsoft Word and other applications, styles in Horizon Reports allow you to define a consistent appearance for certain types of objects. For example, perhaps all objects in the DetailBand should use Tahoma 10pt but objects in the GroupHeader bands should use Tahoma 10pt Bold. This can easily be done by creating two styles and then setting the Style property of each object to the appropriate style. Later if you decide to use a different font, simply change the style and all objects using that style use the new font without having to edit each one manually. Templates use styles extensively for a consistent appearance for all objects. Horizon Reports automatically creates styles for the report based on the styles defined in the template for the report. The styles include ColumnHeadingStyle, used for column heading, DetailBandFieldStyle, used for objects in the detail band, and SummaryFieldStyle, used for summary objects such as grand totals. You can edit any of these styles or create new ones if you wish. ",

That is, objects that appear in the report appear in one of several bands, such as the PageHeader or Detail bands. A bar showing the band name appears at the left of the Layout Area for a band. The space to the right of the bar is for the objects in that band. Click the box for a band to select the band. Click it a second time to collapse it or again to expand it. To resize a band, position your mouse pointer at the bottom of the band’s box and drag up or down. You can also change the height by editing the Height property in the Properties Panel. You cannot make a band smaller than the bottom of the lowest object in the band. The ruler at the left is broken into sections, one for each band. There’s also a ruler at the top. In both rulers, the light-colored part shows the area on the page and the darker part shows the area off the page, including the margins. A grid pattern is laid out over the Layout Area to help you align objects. If an object isn’t quite aligned to the grid, you can click the Align to Grid button in the Properties panel. By default, there are grid lines every 1/8 of an inch. To change the grid scale, select the report in the object list in the Property panel (it’s the object with the spaces in the name of the report replaced with underscores, such as “Customer_Listing_Springy”, and “XtraReport” as the type) and edit the Snap Grid Size property value in the Design section. By default, the measurement units of a report are hundredths of an inch, so a value of 12.5 means grid lines appear every 12.5/100 or 1/8 of an inch. To change the measurement units, edit the value of the Measure Units property in the Behavior section; the choices are Hundredths of an Inch, Tenths of a Millimeter, or Pixels. Click an object to select it. Doing so displays its properties in the Properties panel. You can also select an object in the object list. A selected object displays with small squares, called “handles”, at each corner and in the middle of each side. To resize the object, drag one of the handles until the object is the desired size. To move an object, drag it to the desired position. You can select several objects at the same time by holding down the Ctrl key while you select objects. You can also select multiple objects by clicking outside one of the desired objects and dragging a “marquee” rectangle around the desired objects; any object even partially inside the marquee is selected.

This allows you to choose which table is used for the exclusion matching. The Joins page allows you to change the relationship between tables. This step is only available if the report includes fields from more than one table. Select a pair of tables from the drop-down list and then select how they’re related to each other. The types of relationships you can specify are (in these relationships, Table1 and Table2 refers to the two tables): . | Only records with matches in Table2 and Table2 are displayed. For example, if Table1 has records A, B, and C and Table2 has records A, C, and D, the report only includes records A and C. In the SQL language, this is called an “inner join.” . | All records from Table1 are displayed, with matching records from Table2 where they exist. If there is no match, then Table2 fields are blank. For example, if Table1 has records A, B, and C and Table2 has records A, C, and D, the report includes records A, B, and C but shows blanks for fields from Table2 for record B since there is no record B in Table2. In the SQL language, this is called a “left outer join” (“left” because Table1 is to the left of Table2 in the SQL statement). | All records from Table2 are displayed, with matching records from Table1 where they exist. If there is no match, then Table1 fields are blank. For example, if Table1 has records A, B, and C and Table2 has records A, C, and D, the report includes records A, C, and D but shows blanks for fields from Table1 for record D since there is no record D in Table1. In the SQL language, this is called a “right outer join” (“right” because Table2 is to the right of Table1 in the SQL statement). | All records from both Table1 and Table2 are displayed, with records matched where available. If there is no match, the missing side fields are blank. For example, if Table1 has records A, B, and C and Table2 has records A, C, and D, the report includes records A, B, C, and D but shows blanks for fields from Table1 for record D since there is no record D in Table1 and blanks for fields from Table2 for record B since there is no record B in Table2. In the SQL language, this is called a “full join.” . | . The Nest this join so it’s evaluated first setting allows you to target a specific join to be evalulated first. When this setting is turned on, the resulting SQL Statement will be generated with this join inside a set of parentheses. Most database engines use this syntax to indicate that the join inside the parentheses must be evalulated first. The order that joins are evaluated in normally does not matter, but in certain circumstances with multiple outer joins and filter conditions, you may need to specify precedence to get the desired results. The How to filter on unfavored table setting allows you finer control over how joins are created when there’s an outer join between tables. In SQL, when you specify an outer join between tables, you’re indicating that you want all records from the favored table whether there are matches in the unfavored table or not. If you add a filter condition on the unfavored table, SQL treats it like an inner join: now you only get records from the favored table that have matches in the unfavored table. Because that behavior is unexpected, by default Horizon Reports moves the filter condition to the JOIN clause so the unfavored table is filtered but unmatched records in the favored table are still included. However, there are times when you may not want that behavior; you may want unmatched records eliminated even though it’s an outer join. So, you have a choice about what to do with a filter conditions on the unfavored table: . The choices for this setting are: . | Use default setting: use the behavior defined by the person who set up Horizon Reports. | Include filter conditions in where clause: keep the filter condition in the WHERE clause for the SQL statement, so it acts like an inner join. | Include filter conditions in join: move the filter condition to the JOIN clause for the SQL statement, so it acts like an outer join. | Nest join and filters in a subquery: this is for more complicated cases. In this case, a subquery is used for the entire join and filter conditions. | . The SQL page allows you to customize the SQL statement for the report. SQL, which is an abbreviation for Structured Query Language, is used to retrieve data from the database engine. The SQL statement for the report is the specific statement used for this report’s data. You can add additional fields to the SQL statement (although they won’t appear in the report because they aren’t automatically added to the report layout), add a subquery, or add other clauses. Although you can also edit the relationships between tables in this page, it’s better to use the Joins page to do so. Don’t remove any fields or change field names or you will get an error message when Horizon Reports tries to output the fields it expects to find in the data set to the report layout. You can enter a formatted SQL statement; for example, carriage returns and tabs are permitted. This makes it easier to take a SQL statement from another application and paste it into a report’s SQL statement. If you want to reset the SQL statement back to its default after you’ve changed it, click the Reset button. If the SQL statement entered here has any conditions in the where clause, and you’d like to be prompted for the value of these conditions when running the report, replace the value in the SQL statement with a ? character to act as a placeholder. The report itself must contain a filter condition that corresponds to each condition in the where clause that has a ? placeholder instead of a value. Each ? placeholder character in the SQL Statement will cause a new row of options to appear below the SQL Statement. If this report was created as a SQL Passthrough report, the settings for each parameter will already be filled in. Otherwise, you can enter the value type, caption, and the value of the parameter here. ",

For all other types of fields, you can only have it count the number of values. | If you use a date field as the category or series field, you can specify how the date is displayed. For example, you may want to show the month or year rather than individual dates. | Series are optional. If you don’t specify a series field, the chart only has one series. | As your mouse pointer moves over a data point in a chart, such as a bar in a bar chart, a popup window shows the category and value for the data point. If the chart has a drillthrough subreport, the mouse pointer appears as a hand as it moves over a data point. | . To create a chart report, choose Chart Report from the New menu. There are six steps in the Quick Report Wizard: . | Step 1: Information: specify the report name, comments, and tags. | Step 2: Data Selection: choose the fields for the report and how they should be formatted. | Step 3: Chart Layout: specify which fields go in which section of the chart. | Step 4: Filtering: choose which records to include and exclude. | Step 5: Report Options: specify the type of chart and other options. | Step 6: Security: select which roles can access the report. | . To move from one step to another in the wizard, click the next or previous buttons or choose a specific step number from the toolbar at the bottom. The bottom right of the wizard has buttons to preview the report, cancel editing the report, or finish and save the report. You can preview your report any time after you have selected at least one field in the report. This is handy, since you can change something in the report, preview it to see how it looks, change it, preview again, and so on. ",

Click the button to have the Table drop-down list show only tables that are directly related to tables already selected for the report. To scroll the list of fields, drag the scroll bar at the right of the list or use your mouse wheel. Horizon Reports by default displays fields in alphabetical order. This makes it easy to find a field in the list. However, sometimes it makes more sense to display fields in the order they appear in the table. For example, for typical address fields, you would see this order alphabetically: . Address City Contact Name Country Customer Name Postal Code Region . whereas they’d appear like this in table order: . Customer Name Contact Name Address City Region Postal Code Country . Click the button to display fields in table order. Click to display them alphabetically. If there are a lot of fields in the Available fields list, it may be difficult to find the one you want. Click the button and type some text in the box that appears; the list of available fields now displays only those fields containing that text somewhere in the name or caption.

    "content": "In Step 3, you specify which fields appear in which places in the report. The way you do that is by dragging a field name from the Available fields list to the appropriate section. There are three places a field can appear: . | A category field appears in the category, or X, axis of most types of charts. For others, such as pie charts, a category field is used for something else, like the slices of a pie. For example, to show a chart of sales by product by year, use the product name as the category field. | A data field is the numeric value for each category item in the chart. For some types of charts, this is used to determine the size of a shape, such as the slice of a pie. For all other charts, it’s used for the values, or Y, axis. For example, to show a chart of sales by product by year, use the sale amount as the values field. | A series field is used to create multiple charts. For example, to show a chart of sales by product by year, use the sale date as the series field and display the year rather than individual dates using the Field Properties dialog. Not all charts have a series field. | . For example, to use the Amount field as a data field, select it in the list and drag it to the Data fields section. Any fields left in the Available list are not used in any way in chart reports. You can only have one category and one series field; if you try to drag more than one field into those areas, a warning displays and the field returns to its former location. However, you can have more than one field in the data section: in that case, each field is charted separately as a series. If you have more than one data field, you can’t have a series field. If you have a series field, you can’t drag more than one field to the data area. Here’s an example that shows Total Price and Quantity both used as data fields: . To remove a field from a section in the report, drag it from the appropriate box back to the Available fields list. To change the properties of a field in the Series field list, select it to display its properties at the right. The only choices are Use default format and Format; see the Formatting Values topic for details on how to format values in a report. To change the properties of a field in the Category field list, select it to display its properties at the right. The choices are: . | Use default format and Format: see the Formatting Values topic for details on how to format values in a report. | Sort on this field: by default, the report is not sorted. If you want the results sorted on the values of the category field in ascending (from lowest to highest) or descending (highest to lowest) order, click the appropriate button: or . Click the button to turn off sorting on the category field. | . Fields in the Data fields list show the summary type for the field, which by default is Sum for numeric fields and Count for all other field types. To change the properties of fields in this list, select it to display its properties at the right. The choices are: . | Use default format and Format: see the Formatting Values topic for details on how to format values in a report. | Summary type: this option allows you to specify whether a total (“sum”), count, count distinct, average, highest, or lowest value appears for this field. The difference between Count and Count Distinct is that Count counts the number of records while Count Distinct counts the number of records having unique values on this field. For example, if there are 100 order records but all orders were placed this week, using Count on the Order Date field would display 100 but Count Distinct would display 7 (assuming at least one order was placed every day this week). Choose the desired function from the drop-down list. | Sort on this field: by default, the report is not sorted. If you want the results sorted on the values of the data field in ascending (from lowest to highest) or descending (highest to lowest) order, click the appropriate button: or . Click the button to turn off sorting on the data field. For example, here’s a report that isn’t sorted on the data field. Notice that it’s in alphabetical order by category. This one is sorted in descending order on the data field, so the bars are arranged with the largest total sales at the left. | Axis location: this option, which only appears if there’s more than one data field, allows you to choose which axis, left or right, is used to display values for the selected field. The default is Left axis. | . ",

As you make changes to the various options in this step, the sample chart displayed in this step automatically adjusts to show you what the chart looks like using your settings. However, it does not show actual data from your database; to do that, click the Preview button. The Delete Advanced Layout button, which is only enabled if the report has an advanced layout, removes the advanced layout from the report. The Drillthrough Properties button displays the Drillthough Properties dialog so you can define subreports for this report. This button is disabled if you haven’t selected any fields for the report. The Advanced Report Properties button displays the Advanced Report Properties dialog so you can change some advanced settings. This button is disabled if you haven’t selected any fields for the report. The settings on the General page are: . | Width: the desired width of the chart. | Height: the desired height of the chart. | Localize: if this option is turned on, which it is by default, the report is “localized” when it’s run. Localizing a report meaning translating text into the language the user running the reports has chosen in the Options dialog. If you turn this option off, the report is run with these things in the language the report was created in. | Table layout: by default, Horizon Reports uses absolute positioning to render a report in the Preview window. While that normally works well, if you find that some objects aren’t positioned properly, you may wish to use HTML tables to render the report instead. In that case, turn this setting on. | Chart series: this specifies which series you want the Chart type setting to affect. If there’s more than one data field, the maximum value is the number of data fields; that is, if you have two data fields, the values for Chart series are 1 and 2. If there’s a series field, the maximum value is 10. This option only appears if there’s more than one data field or if there’s a series field. | Chart type: select the type of chart you want from the drop-down list. The choices are shown in the following table. The “Series” column shows “Single” for chart types that only appear when there’s no series field, “Multiple” for chart types that only appear when there is a series field, and “Both” for either case. | Type | Description | Series | Sample | . | Area | Displays series as filled areas on a diagram, with each data point displayed as a peak or hollow in the area. This is useful when you need to show trends for several series on the same diagram and also show the relationship of the parts to the whole. | Both | | . | Area 3D | A 3-D version of an area chart. | Both | | . | Bar | Displays series as individual bars, grouped by category, and the height of each bar is determined by the series value. | Both | | . | Bar 3D | A 3-D version of a bar chart. | Both | | . | Doughnut | Similar to a pie chart but with a hole in the middle | Single | | . | Doughnut 3D | A 3-D version of a doughnut chart. | Single | | . | Funnel | A chart that resembles a funnel. This is often used for values that decrease with time, stage, or other measure, such as a sales funnel. | Single | | . | Funnel 3D | A 3-D version of a funnel chart. | Single | | . | Full Stacked Area | Similar to an area chart but the value of each data point is stacked with all the other corresponding data point values so the height of the area is always the full height of the chart. This is useful for comparing the percentage values of several series for the same category value. | Multiple | | . | Full Stacked Area 3D | The 3-D version of a Full Stacked Area chart. | Multiple | | . | Full Stacked Bar | Similar to a bar chart but the value of each data point is stacked with all the other corresponding data point values so the height of the bar is always the full height of the chart. This is useful for comparing the percentage values of several series for the same category value. | Multiple | | . | Full Stacked Bar 3D | The 3-D version of a Full Stacked Bar chart. | Multiple | | . | Full Stacked Line | Similar to a line chart but the value of each data point is stacked with all the other corresponding data point values so the top line is always at the top of the chart. This is useful to compare how much each series adds to the total value for a given category value. | Multiple | | . | Full Stacked Line 3D | The 3-D version of a Full Stacked Line chart. | Multiple | | . | Full Stacked Spline Area | Similar to a Full Stack Area chart but with smooth, rounded lines. | Multiple | | . | Full Stacked Spline Area 3D | The 3-D version of a Full Stacked Spline Area chart. | Multiple | | . | Line | Displays values connected by lines. This is useful to show trends for several series on the same chart and to compare the values of several series for the same category values. | Both | | . | Line 3D | A 3-D version of a line chart. | Both | | . | Manhattan Bar | A bar chart in which the bars are arranged front-to-back instead of side-by-side. So called because it resembles the tall buildings in Manhattan. | Multiple | | . | Pie | Useful to compare the percentage values of different points in the same series and to show these values as easy to understand pie slices. | Single | | . | Pie 3D | A 3-D version of a pie chart. | Single | | . | Point | Displays each data value as a point. | Both | | . | Scatter Line | Displays data points in the same order as they are in the result set, as opposed to other chart types that sort their points in some way. | Both | | . | Spline | Similar to a line chart but with a smooth, rounded line. | Both | | . | Spline 3D | A 3-D version of a spline chart. | Both | | . | Spline Area | Similar to an area chart but with smooth, rounded lines. | Both | | . | Spline Area 3D | A 3-D version of a spline area chart. | Both | | . | Stacked Area | Similar to an area chart but the value of each data point is stacked with all the other corresponding data point values.

In addition to whether there is a series field or not, there are some other rules regarding which chart types are available. Generally, the chart type you select for the first series affects the choices available for the rest of the series because not all chart types are compatible with each other. Here are the rules: . | If there’s more than one data field, only the 2-D versions of charts are available. | Because you can’t mix 2-D and 3-D charts, if you choose a 2-D chart type, such as Bar, for the first series, the list only shows 2-D types for the rest of the series. Similarly, if you choose a 3-D chart type for the first series, the list only shows 3-D types for the rest. | Because full stacked charts only work with themselves, if you choose one of them for the first series, the Chart series setting disappears and that chart type is used for all series. | . How do you decide what type of chart to create? It depends on the type of data you have and how you want to present it. The Extreme Presentation Method blog has a diagram that illustrates the type of chart to choose based on what you want to show. The Color page has the following options: . | Appearance: selecting an appearance controls the colors of data items, chart background, and legend. | Palette: this option allows you to select one of several palettes of colors for your chart. | Palette color number: this allows you to set the base color used for all data points. Set this to 0 (the default) to use all colors of the selected palette or a specific value to use shades of one color for all data points. | . The Background page has the following options: . | Fill mode: indicates how the background of the chart is drawn. “Empty” means use no color (that is, white), “Gradient” means use gradient colors, “Hatch” means use hatch marks, and “Solid” (the default) means use solid colors. | Background color: the background color to use. This option doesn’t appear if Fill mode is set to “Gradient.” . | From color: this option, which is only available if you set Fill mode to “Gradient,” allows you to select the starting color for the gradient. The background is drawn in a gradient that transitions from From color to that of To color. | To color: this option, which is only available if you set Fill mode to “Gradient,” allows you to select the ending color for the gradient. The background is drawn in a gradient that transitions from From color to that of To color. | Gradient mode: specifies in which direction the gradient flows. The choices are bottom left to top right, bottom right to top left, bottom to top, from center horizontal, from center vertical, left to right, right to left, to center horizontal, to center vertical, top left to bottom right, top right to bottom left, and top to bottom. This only appears if you set Fill mode to “Gradient.” . | Hatch color: the color to use for the hatches. This option only appears if Fill mode is set to “Hatch.” . | Hatch style: this setting, which is only available if Fill mode is set to “Hatch,” indicates which hatch style to use for the background. There are many choices available. | . The Point Labels page allows you to control the appearance of the point labels, those labels inside the chart showing the values of each data point. The choices are: . | Visible: turn this setting off if you don’t want point labels to appear or on if you do want them to appear. | Resolve overlap mode: this controls how to resolve labels that overlap when there are many data points or the values are long. The choices are: . | None: does nothing. | Default: randomly changes the position of labels that are overlapped to avoid the overlap. | Hide overlapped: hides those point labels that are overlapped by another. Note: this mode doesn’t affect Pie, Doughnut, and Funnel charts. | Justify around point: changes the position of overlapped labels so they appear around the corresponding point’s center, but their indent from the point center is preserved. Note: this mode doesn’t affect Pie, Doughnut, Bar and Column charts. | Justify all around point: like Justify around point but affects all labels, whether overlapped or not. Note: this mode doesn’t affect Pie, Doughnut, Bar and Column charts. | . | . You can specify whether a legend appears on the chart using the settings on the Legend page. If a series field is used, the legend shows the different series values. If there’s more than one data field, the legend shows the fields. Otherwise, the legend shows the different category values. This page has the following options: . | Visible: turn this option on to display a legend on the chart. | Shadow: turn this option on to display a shadow behind the legend. | Font: the font name, size, and style to use for the text in the legend. | Horizontal alignment: this option specifies where the legend appears horizontally on the chart. The choices are Left Outside and Right Outside. | Vertical alignment: this option specifies where the legend appears vertically on the chart. The choices are Top, Center, and Bottom. | Legend display type: this option specifies what to display in the legend: values only (Value), categories only (Category), or categories and values (Both). | . The X Axis and Y Axis pages have several subpages. The options on these subpages are identical. The options on the General subpage are: . | Number of minor tick marks/grid lines: this option affects both minor tick marks and minor grid lines for 2-D reports and only minor grid lines for 3-D reports. Set the desired number you wish to use. | Axis line color: the color to use for the axis line. This option isn’t available for 3-D reports. | Alternating bands: turn this option on to have alternating bands of color appear perpendicular to the axis. | Alternating band color: the color to use for the alternating bands. | . | Automatic Range: this option only appears when you edit the properties for the Y-Axis. Turn this off to change the values for Min value, Max value, and Side margin. These values represent the desired manual range for the Y-Axis, with the side margin value representing an optional range for the axis above the maximum Y-Axis value. | . The Label subpage has the following options: . | Visible: turn this setting on to display labels on the axis. | Angle: this setting controls the angle the labels appear at. The default for X-axis labels is 315 so they appear slanted and don’t overlap. The default for Y-axis labels is 0 since they can’t overlap. | Font: the font name, size, and style to use for the labels. | Text color: the color to use for the labels. | Staggered: if labels on the X-axis are fairly long, they can overlap each other. Turn this setting on to stagger the labels to minimize the overlap. | . The Grid Lines subpage has the following options: . | Major grid lines visible: turn this setting on to display major grid lines on the axis. | Major grid lines color: this setting specifies the color of the major grid lines. | Major grid lines dash style: this setting specifies the style of the major grid lines. The choices are Dash, Dash dot, Dash dot dot, Dot, or Solid (the default). | Minor grid lines visible: turn this setting on to display minor grid lines on the axis. | Minor grid lines color: this setting specifies the color of the minor grid lines. | Minor grid lines dash style: this setting specifies the style of the minor grid lines. The choices are Dash, Dash dot, Dash dot dot, Dot, or Solid (the default). | . If you’re not sure whether you should use grid lines or not, Grid Lines in Graphs are Rarely Useful by Stephen Few has some interesting ideas. The Tick Marks subpage doesn’t appear for 3-D reports. It has the following options: . | Major tick marks visible: turn this setting on to display major tick marks on the axis. | Major tick marks length: the length of the major tick marks. | Minor tick marks visible: turn this setting on to display minor tick marks on the axis. | Minor tick marks length: the length of the minor tick marks. | . The Title subpage doesn’t appear for 3-D reports. It has the following options: . | Visible: turn this setting on to display a title for the axis. | Axis title: the title for the axis. | Text color: the color to use for the title. | Font: the font name, size, and style to use for the title. | Alignment: the alignment for the title: Center (the default), Far (right aligned for left-to-right reading or left aligned for right-to-left reading), or Near (left aligned for left-to-right reading or right aligned for right-to-left reading). | . The settings on the Title page control the chart title. The options are: . | Title: the title for the chart, which defaults to whatever you entered for Name. If you want to use an expression rather than fixed text, surround the expression with “{“ and “}” (without the quotes). Note that the expression must evaluate to a string value, so use the Str() function if necessary to convert non-string values such as dates and numbers to their string equivalent. Here’s an example of an expression that displays “Sales for \" (such as \"Sales for December 2015\") in the report header: . {\"Sales for \" + MonthName(Now()) + \" \" + Str(Year(Now()))} . Suppose the report has an ask-at-runtime condition on Country and you want to display “Sales for country” in the title, where country is the country chosen by the user when they run the report. In that case, use the GetConditionValue function: . {\"Sales for \" + GetConditionValue(0, 0)} . This expression displays the name of the report and the data source it reports on. {Name + \"\\n\" + DataSource} . (The “\\n” is a line break.) . | Alignment: the alignment for the title: Center (the default), Far (right aligned for left-to-right reading or left aligned for right-to-left reading), or Near (left aligned for left-to-right reading or right aligned for right-to-left reading). | Dock style: where on the chart the title should appear: Bottom, Left, Right, or Top (the default). | Font: the font name, size, and style to use for the title. | Text color: the color to use for the title. | Title spacing: the amount of space between the title and the chart. | Word wrap: turn this setting on to allow a long title to word wrap onto more than one line. If this is turned off (the default), text beyond the area of the chart is cut off. | Max line count: if Word wrap is turned on and you have a very long title, this specifies how many lines the title may take. 0 means as many lines as necessary. | . The Data page has the following options. | Always run: turn this option on to run the report even when there are no records that match your filter condition. This results in a blank report. If this option is turned off, rather than displaying a blank report, Horizon Reports displays a message that there are no records. | Distinct: if you filter on a field from a table that isn’t involved in the report, you may end up with what appear to be duplicate records. For example, say your report displays the Company Name and Contact Name from the Customers table. If you filter on the Product Name from the Products table being “Apricot Jam” (in other words, you want a list of customers who bought that product), you’d end up with each customer showing up once for every order they placed for that product. So, if Sam’s Grocery ordered it 25 times, they’d appear on the report 25 times. That isn’t typically something you’d want, so Horizon Reports can eliminate these duplicate records for you. The DISTINCT clause in a SQL statement tells the database to only find records that have distinct values, so adding that clause to the SQL statement means that Sam’s Grocery only shows up once. The Retrieve distinct records option allows you to control whether the DISTINCT clause is used or not. “Never” means don’t add a DISTINCT clause to the SQL statement for this report and “Always” means do add it. “If filtering on a table not in the report” means only add the DISTINCT clause if you filter on a field from a table that isn’t involved in the report. You might think that “If filtering on a table not in the report” should always be used. However, there may be times when this isn’t the correct behavior. For example, if you want to show fields from the Orders table (Order Date, Product Name, and Quantity Ordered) but filter on Company Name is “Sam’s Grocery,” Horizon Reports eliminates what it thinks are duplicate records, such as two orders for the same product and same quantity on the same day.

    "doc": "Creating a Cross-Tab Report",
    "title": "Creating a Cross-Tab Report",
    "content": "A cross-tabulation (or “cross-tab”) report is one that summarizes information in your database. It’s laid out in a grid, with rows representing one “fact” (for example, country, date, or salesperson), columns representing another, and the intersection of rows and columns containing the summarized information. It’s similar to a PivotTable in Microsoft Excel. For example, you may want to see a breakdown of your sales by country and product category. In this case, the rows would be the different countries your customers are in, the columns would be the category names, and the cell at the intersection of a specific row and column would be the total sales for that category in that country. To create a cross-tab report, select at least three fields you want to appear in the report, and then select where each field goes. A row field is one that has each different value appear in a row in the report. A column field is one that has each different value appear in a column in the report. A data field is one that’s summarized and placed in the cells at the intersection of rows and columns. Here are some notes about how cross-tabs work: . | You can have more than one row field. For example, you may want sales by country and within country, by state. Choose both the country and state fields, and select country as the first row field and state as the second. The report shows each state in each country, with subtotals for each country. | You can have more than one column field. For example, you may want product category and within category, by product name. Choose both the product category and product name fields, and select product category as the first column field and product name as the second. The report shows each product in each category, with subtotals for each category. Note that using more than one column field can make the report much longer and take more time to run. | You can specify how the data field is summarized. For numeric fields, the default is to sum the values, but you can use another type of summarization, such as average. For all other types of fields, you can only have it count the number of values. | If you use a date field as a row or column field, you can specify how the date is displayed. For example, you may want to show the month or year rather than the individual dates. | You can have more than one data field. For example, if you want to show not only the total sales amount but also the count of how many sales there were, select the amount field and some other field, and make them both data fields. The amount field is summed and the other field is counted. | Since there may be a lot of rows and/or columns, depending on the fields you choose, Horizon Reports automatically horizontally paginates the report for you. This is similar to how spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel print multi-page reports. Horizon Reports prints a page for the first set of rows and columns, then the next page has the same set of rows but more columns, and so on until all of the columns have been printed. Then it prints the next set of rows and the first set of columns, and continues in this manner until all columns and all rows have been printed. | There are optionally totals for each row and each column, and a grand total at the end of the report. | . There are six steps in the Cross-Tabulation Report Wizard: . | Step 1: Information: specify the report name, comments, and tags. | Step 2: Data Selection: choose the fields for the report and how they should be formatted. | Step 3: Cross-Tabulation Layout: select what area fields go in. | Step 4: Filtering: choose which records to include and exclude. | Step 5: Report Options: specify the orientation, template, paper size, margins, and other options. | Step 6: Security: select which roles can access the report. | . To move from one step to another in the wizard, click the next or previous buttons or choose a specific step number from the toolbar at the bottom. The bottom right of the wizard has buttons to preview the report, cancel editing the report, or finish and save the report. You can preview your report any time after you have selected at least three fields in step 2 and defined where those fields go in step 3. This is handy, since you can change something in the report, preview it to see how it looks, change it, preview again, and so on. ",

The title, which defaults to whatever you entered for Name, appears at the top of every page of the report. If you want to use an expression rather than fixed text, surround the expression with “{“ and “}” (without the quotes). Note that the expression must evaluate to a string value, so use the Str() function if necessary to convert non-string values such as dates and numbers to their string equivalent. Here’s an example of an expression that displays “Sales for \" (such as \"Sales for December 2015\") in the report header: . {\"Sales for \" + MonthName(Now()) + \" \" + Str(Year(Now()))} . Suppose the report has an ask-at-runtime condition on Country and you want to display “Sales for country” in the title, where country is the country chosen by the user when they run the report. In that case, use the GetConditionValue function: . {\"Sales for \" + GetConditionValue(0, 0)} . This expression displays the name of the report and the data source it reports on. {Name + \"\\n\" + DataSource} . (The “\\n” is a line break.) . | Orientation: the default choice, Automatic, means that if the report is too wide to fit in portrait orientation, it automatically switches to landscape. However, you can override this by choosing either Portrait or Landscape to force the report to be printed in the desired orientation. | Template: this specifies the template, which determines the overall layout of the report. The default template for a new report is determined by the Default cross-tab template setting in the Options dialog, but if other templates are available, you may select the desired one from the drop-down list. Note that if your report contains Unicode characters, you may wish to use a “Unicode” template or the report may not display the characters properly when output to PDF. | Paper type: if this option is turned on, which it is by default, the paper type defined in the template is used for the report. Turn this off to use a different paper type, which you can choose from the drop-down list. All standard paper types, such as letter, legal, and A4, are supported. Note that if you choose Custom for the paper type, you can enter the height and width of the custom type. | Margin: these options control the left, right, top, and bottom margins of the report. If these options are turned on, which they are by default, the margins defined in the template are used for the report. Turn these off individually to use a different margin. | Localize: if this option is turned on, which it is by default, the report is “localized” when it’s run. Localizing a report meaning translating column headings and other things like “Page 1 of 2” into the language the user running the reports has chosen in the Options dialog. If you turn this option off, the report is run with these things in the language the report was created in. | Table layout: by default, Horizon Reports uses absolute positioning to render a report in the Preview window. While that normally works well, if you find that some objects aren’t positioned properly, you may wish to use HTML tables to render the report instead. In that case, turn this setting on. | Database in Header: turn this option on to display the name of the database the report is being run against in the header of the report. | Always run: turn this option on to run the report even when there are no records that match your filter condition. This results in a blank report. If this option is turned off, rather than displaying a blank report, Horizon Reports displays a message that there are no records. | Location: by default, row and column totals (subtotals when more than one column or row field is used) are shown at the end of a set of row or column values (the “After Values” setting). Set this to “Before Values” to show subtotals at the start of the set instead. This option is disabled if there’s only one row or column field. | Totals: turn this option on, which it is by default, to display row or column totals (subtotals when more than one column or row field is used) or off to omit them. This option is disabled if there’s only one row or column field. | Grand totals: turn this option on, which it is by default, to display row or column grand totals at the end of the report or off to omit them. | Hide nulls: by default, values for which there is no data (known as “null;” for example, if the report shows sales by country and product and there are no sales for Widgets in Moldovia) displays as a blank space. If you want to display zero instead, turn this setting on. | Distinct: if you filter on a field from a table that isn’t involved in the report, you may end up with what appear to be duplicate records. For example, say your report displays the number of companies by sales territory. If you filter on the Product Name from the Products table being “Apricot Jam” (in other words, you only want to include customers who bought that product), you’d end up with the counts being too high: each customer is counted once for every order they placed for that product. That isn’t typically something you’d want, so Horizon Reports can eliminate these duplicate records for you. The DISTINCT clause in a SQL statement tells the database to only find records that have distinct values, so adding that clause to the SQL statement means that each customer is only counted once. The Retrieve distinct records option allows you to control whether the DISTINCT clause is used or not. “Never” means don’t add a DISTINCT clause to the SQL statement for this report and “Always” means do add it. “If filtering on a table not in the report” means only add the DISTINCT clause if you filter on a field from a table that isn’t involved in the report. You might think that “If filtering on a table not in the report” should always be used. However, there may be times when this isn’t the correct behavior. For example, if you want to show fields from the Orders table (Order Date, Product Name, and Quantity Ordered) but filter on Company Name is “Sam’s Grocery,” Horizon Reports eliminates what it thinks are duplicate records, such as two orders for the same product and same quantity on the same day. Clearly, this isn’t right—you’d end up with some missing data. In that case, set this option to Never. | Top N: this option allows you to display only the top records. If you set this option to something other than “No,” you can enter a number and indicate whether that number is the number of records you want (the “Count” setting) or a percentage of the total records such as the top 10 percent (the “Percent” setting). Note that “top” refers to the sort order for the report. For example, if the report is sorted alphabetically by Company Name, you’ll get the specified number of records in alphabetical order. If the report is sorted in descending by Order Date, you get the specified number of most recent orders. | . ",

These options are used in the Preview window when you email the report or upload it to an FTP server. Using the toolbar at the top of the Export Options window, you can pick a file output type, and then save, email, or upload the report to an FTP server. This allows you to directly output the report without previewing it first. The file types available for direct output are the same as those covered in the topic about previewing. The export options are organized in to 4 categories, and each category will initially appear collapsed if the default settings have not been changed. Click on the category name to expand the section and make the options in that category visible. The export options in the General section are: . | File name: the name of the file to export to. Note: don’t specify an extension for the file, as one will be added automatically depending on the type of file you choose in the Preview toolbar. | Add timestamp: turn this option on to add a timestamp to the file name, using the format “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.” For example, if the file name you choose is “My Report.PDF” and you run the report at 1:17 p.m. on March 25, 2014, the actual name of the file is “My Report 20140325131737.PDF.” This is useful if you output the report several times and don’t want each run to overwrite the same file. | Output each group as separate file: if you turn this option on, each group in the report is output as a separate file, with the file name being the name you chose followed by the group value. For example, if you have a report showing customers grouped by country and specify “Customers.PDF” as the file name, turning this option on results in files named “Customers Argentina.PDF” (including only customers from Argentina), “Customers Austria.PDF” (including only customers from Austria), and so on. This is useful if, for example, you want to create an invoice for each customer without having to run an invoice report multiple times, each with a filter on a different customer name. This option is only available if there’s at least one grouped field in the report. The individual files are zipped up into a single file which is downloaded to your browser. | Password: fill this in if you want to password protect the file. In the case of a PDF file, the file itself is encrypted; other file types are added to an encrypted ZIP file using the same name as the output file but with a “zip” extension. | Separator character: The character to use as a separator when outputting to CSV format. A comma is the default separator. | . The options in the Email section are: . | Email recipients: the recipients of the email. Any email address entered here is saved for future use. When entering values in this field, a drop-down list appears containing any recipients that have been saved previously.

Note that the expression must evaluate to a string value, so use the Str() function if necessary to convert non-string values such as dates and numbers to their string equivalent. Here’s an example of an expression that displays “Sales for \" (such as \"Sales for December 2015\") in the report header: . {\"Sales for \" + MonthName(Now()) + \" \" + Str(Year(Now()))} . This expression displays the name of the report and the data source it reports on. {Name + \"\\n\" + DataSource} . (The “\\n” is a line break.) . | Email body: the body of the email. Like Subject, you can use an expression in Email body. | Get email address from field: this option, which is only available if Output each group as separate file is turned on, uses a field from the report as the email address to send the group’s file to. To follow the example from the previous item, suppose you wanted to email an invoice to each customer. Make sure the report includes the field containing the customer’s email address, even if the Display in report setting is turned off for that field, then turn on Get email address from field and select the field containing the email address from the drop-down list beside this option.

    "title": "Selecting Which Records to Exclude",
    "content": "The Filter Conditions section in the Filter page of the report wizards allows you to determine which records to include in the report. The Exclude Conditions section allows you to specify which records to exclude from the report. We call this a “negative” query because it looks for the absence of data, such as all customers you didn’t contact in 2007 or all customers who didn’t buy Widgets. You may think that the way to do this is to filter on Contact Date is not between 01/01/2007 and 12/31/2007 or Product Name is not equal to Widgets. However, this doesn’t give the results you expect for two reasons: . | If you contacted the customer in 2006 or 2008, you’ll get those records since they match the condition Contact Date is not between 01/01/2007 and 12/31/2007. However, that doesn’t mean you didn’t contact them in 2007. Similarly, you’ll get all customers who bought anything other than Widgets but that doesn’t mean they didn’t buy Widgets at all. | Because of the way database queries work, the absence of data means no records are retrieved using a normal filter condition. For example, if there are no activity records for a customer in 2007, there is nothing to retrieve from the database, so no customers are displayed. | . The solution is to use an exclude filter. This tells Horizon Reports to exclude those records matching the exclude conditions. For example, creating an exclude filter on Contact Date is between 01/01/2007 and 12/31/2007 means you want to exclude customers who have an activity record in 2007, which therefore gives you those customers who did not have an activity record in 2007. To get customers who didn’t buy Widgets, use an exclude filter of Product Name equals Widget. This excludes those customers who bought Widgets, so it gives you everyone who didn’t buy Widgets. The way an exclude filter works is that it first takes all records, then it removes those matching the exclude conditions, leaving the rest, which obviously don’t match the conditions. Creating an exclude condition is just like creating a normal filter condition. The only difference is that the conditions you specify for an exclude filter are used to exclude records from the query rather than include as a filter would normally do. Note that exclude conditions shouldn’t be used in place of a normal “not equals” filter. For example, if you want a list of customers who aren’t in Germany, use a normal filter condition of Country does not equal Germany rather than an exclude condition of Country equals Germany. ",

    "title": "Group Filtering",
    "content": "Suppose you want a list of customers whose total sales are more than $500. Creating a filter condition of “Invoice Amount is greater than 500” won’t do that because filter conditions work on individual records. In that case, the report shows those customers who have individual invoices of more than $500. To create a filter based on a total, you need to use a grouping condition instead. The filtering step (step 4) of the Quick Report Wizard has three types of conditions: filter conditions, exclude conditions, and grouping conditions. To create a grouping condition, click the Grouping conditions button. Grouping conditions work similar to filter conditions—you can create multiple conditions and group them if necessary—but have some additional settings you have to fill in. The first thing you have to select is the type of summarization to do to the data to create the value for the filter. The choices are Sum, Average, Highest, Lowest, Count, Count Distinct, or Concatenation. Sum and Average are only available for numeric fields. Concatenation is used for text fields when you want to combine the values of several records into a single, comma-separated value in one record. The difference between Count and Count Distinct is that Count counts the number of records while Count Distinct counts the number of records having unique values in this field. For example, if there are 100 order records but all orders were placed this week, using Count on the Order Date field would display 100 but Count Distinct would display 7 (assuming at least one order was placed every day this week). The next thing to select is the field to do the summarization on. In the example above, it would be Invoice Amount. The drop-down list of fields only displays those fields in the report, so be sure to add the field you want to use to the Selected fields list in step 2. Next choose the field to do the grouping of values on. In the example above, it would be Customer Name. As with the summarization field, this field needs to be included in the report. As with a regular filter condition, choose the operator for the grouping condition from the drop-down list and enter the values for the condition. If you want to be prompted to enter the values when you run the report, turn on the Ask at runtime option. By default, grouping conditions are displayed in the header of the report. If you don’t want a particular condition to be displayed, turn off the Display in report header setting. This is useful for reports that have a lot of conditions, which can get quite long when listed in the report header. You might in that case turn this option off for all but ask-at-runtime conditions. The condition is displayed in the report header as Field Operator Value, such as “City equals San Francisco” or “Active Is Yes.” If you want to customize the description, turn on Custom description and enter the desired description. For example, “Active customers” might be a more meaningful description than “Active Is Yes.” If you want to use an expression rather than fixed text, surround the expression with “{“ and “}” (without the quotes).

    "title": "Connection",
    "content": "Conditions are connected together with a connection. The connection can be either AND or OR. The AND connection means the two conditions it connects must both be true for a record to be included in the report, while the OR connection means that either one or both can be true for a record to be included. You can think of AND as “more restrictive.” For example, if the first condition is “City equals San Francisco,” that gives a certain set of records. Adding a second condition such as “Order Amount is greater than 100.00” using the AND connection means that for any given record, the city must be San Francisco and the order amount must be greater than $100.00. Since that excludes San Francisco records with an order amount of less than $100.00 (which just specifying the first condition includes), these two conditions together are more restrictive (there are fewer records in the report) than either of these conditions alone. You can think of OR as “less restrictive.” For example, if the first condition is “City equals San Francisco” and you add a second condition such as “City equals Los Angeles” using the OR connection, this means that for any given record, the city can either be San Francisco or Los Angeles. These two conditions together are less restrictive than either of these conditions alone, since the report includes records matching both conditions. Notice the use of AND and OR with filters can be the opposite of how these words are used in English. For example, someone might say “print out all of our customers from San Francisco and Los Angeles.” You might think you use the AND connection in this case, but in fact you use the OR connection since you want records where the city is either San Francisco or Los Angeles. The way to think of it is this: for each record, check each condition. It is not possible, for example, for the city for any one record to be both San Francisco and Los Angeles at the same time. It could be either one, however, so OR is the correct connection to use. Watch out if you need to use both AND and OR connections in a filter. Conditions connected with AND are evaluated before those connected with OR. For example, if you want all customers from San Francisco or Los Angeles where the sales amount is more than $50, you might think you could use “City equals San Francisco or City equals Los Angeles and Sales is greater than 50.” However, this likely won’t give you the results you want because the AND is evaluated first. So, this gives all customers from Los Angeles where the sales amount is more than $50 (the second and third conditions ANDed) or those from San Francisco regardless of the sales amount (the first condition). If you need to use both AND and OR connections in a filter, you need to use filter groups. All the conditions in a filter group use the same connection. Filter groups are connected together using another connection. So, to get all customers from San Francisco or Los Angeles where the sales amount is more than $50, use one filter group of “City equals San Francisco or City equals Los Angeles” and another of “Sales is greater than 50.” The two groups are connected using AND. Internally, the filter condition is handled with parentheses: “(City equals San Francisco or City equals Los Angeles) and Sales is greater than 50.” However, filter groups make it easier to understand how the conditions are combined than worrying about where parentheses should go and how many there are.

If you already have at least one condition in the filter group, the Filter Condition dialog appears a little differently. The connection button, which does not appear if this is the first condition for your filter group, is used to define how this condition is connected to the previous condition in your filter. The default connection is and, but you can also choose or by clicking the button. See the Creating a Filter topic for a discussion of how connections work. The black brace shows which conditions are connected with a particular connection. The table drop-down list shows the tables you can select fields from. The field drop-down list shows the fields you can filter on from the selected table. The Fields drop-down list allows you to determine which fields are displayed when creating a filter condition. Show all fields means display all fields whether they are included in the report or not, Show selected fields only means display only those fields in the Selected Fields list for the report, and Show selected tables only means display only those tables being used in the report. After selecting a field, select a comparison operator from the operator drop-down list. The options that appear in this list depend on the type of field selected. For example, for Boolean (true or false or yes or no) fields, the only choices that appear are is Yes and is No. See the Creating a Filter topic for a discussion of how operators work. Once you’ve selected an operator, you may enter a value to compare to the field. You won’t be allowed to enter a value if you choose the is blank, is not blank, is Yes, or is No operators. If you choose the is between or is not between operators, you must enter two values. If you choose the is one of or is not one of operators, you can enter up to ten different values. When you start typing a value, Horizon Reports checks whether there are any values in the field the filter condition is for that start with what you’ve typed. If so, it displays the choices in a drop-down list. For example, if your database contains cities named San Cristóbal and San Francisco, you’ll see the following when you type “San”: . If you’re not sure what values appear in the field or want to select a value without having to type it, click the button. A list of unique values from the field appears in the Field Values dialog. You can choose a single value or multiple values; to select more than one value, hold down the Ctrl key as you click the desired values. If you choose more than one, the operator is automatically changed to is one of. If you select a date field, type the desired date in the format YYYY-MM-DD (or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS if Use date only is turned off), where YYYY is the year, MM is the month number, DD is the day number, HH is the hours, MM is the minutes, and SS is the seconds; for example, January 4, 2014 is 2014-01-04. To display the date without the time, turn on Use date only. Instead of typing the date, you can click the button at the right of the text box to display a calendar. When the calendar is displayed, you can select a date by simply clicking it. Click the left or right arrows to move to the previous or next month. Click the month at the top of the calendar to display a list of months in the selected year you can select from. Clicking a month moves the calendar to that month. Click the left or right arrows to move to the previous or next year. Click the year at the top of the calendar to display a list of years in the selected decade. Clicking a year displays the months for that year. Click the left or right arrows to move to the previous or next decade. If Use date only is turned off, the bottom of the calendar has a button. Click this button to display the time with up and down buttons to make it easy to change the hours and minutes. If you want to be prompted to enter the values when you run the report, turn on the Ask at runtime option. To compare a field to another field rather than a value, select Field from the Compare to option (the default is Value, which means a value is used). Select the field to compare against in the drop-down list that appears in place of the value text box. Note that this only allows you to select fields from the same table and the same data type as the field you’re filtering on; for example, if you choose a date field, only date fields from the same table appear in the list. Also note that Compare to isn’t available if you choose the is blank, is not blank, is Yes, is No, is one of, or is not one of operators. To compare a field in one table to a field in another table, use a database expression (described next) and specify the name of the field in the other table as the expression. To compare a field to an expression, select either Database Expression or Expression from the Compare to option. The difference between the two is that Database Expression is an expression the database engine evaluates and Expression is an expression that Horizon Reports evaluates. Typically, you’ll use Database Expression to specify a field or a function that you know the database engine can evaluate and you’ll use Expression for any other type of expression. Enter the expression into the text box. For example, to look for all records with a date field falling in the last week, use the “is between” operator and AddDays(Now(), -7) for the first expression and Now() for the second expression. Since Now() gives today’s date and AddDays() adds the specified number of days to a date, AddDays(Now(), -7) is seven days ago, so this gives all records with the date being between one week ago and today. The Expressions and Functions Reference topic has a list of the most useful functions. Note that the “is one of” and “is not one of” operators are only available if Compare to is set to Value. By default, filter conditions are displayed in the header of the report. If you don’t want a particular condition to be displayed, turn off the Display in report header setting. This is useful for reports that have a lot of filter conditions, which can get quite long when listed in the report header. You might in that case turn this option off for all but ask-at-runtime conditions. The condition is displayed in the report header as Field Operator Value, such as “City equals San Francisco” or “Active Is Yes.” If you want to customize the description, turn on Custom description and enter the desired description. For example, “Active customers” might be a more meaningful description than “Active Is Yes.” If you want to use an expression rather than fixed text, surround the expression with “{“ and “}” (without the quotes). Note that the expression must evaluate to a string value, so use the Str() function if necessary to convert non-string values such as dates and numbers to their string equivalent. Here’s an example of an expression that displays “Customers in \" (such as \"Customers in Germany\" if Germany is the value chosen for the filter condition) in the report header: . {\"Customers in \" + GetConditionValue(1)} . GetConditionValue is a built-in function that returns the value for the condition as a string; specify “1” for the first value, “2” for the second value, and so on (a condition only has more than one value if the “is between” or “is one of” operators is used).

To use the example of customers from San Francisco or Los Angeles where the sales amount is more than $50, do the following: . | Click the right-most button to create a new filter group. | Click the left button in the new group to create a filter condition and change the settings for the condition to City equals San Francisco. The filter page should look like this: . | Click the left button in the new group again to create another filter condition and change the settings for the condition to City equals Los Angeles. Click the connection button (which defaults to And) to change it to Or. The filter page should now look like this: . | Click the right-most button in the top (not the new) group to create a filter group. | Click the left button in the new group to create a filter condition and change the settings for the condition to Total Price is greater than 50. The filter page should now look like this: . | . ",

These settings are accessible by clicking the Field Properties button in step 2 of the Quick Report, Cross-Tab Report, and Label Report Wizards; for the Chart Wizard, the settings are in step 3. If the Use default format option is turned on, which it is by default, Horizon Reports uses the defined format for the field. If the format for the field changes in the future, the report uses the new format automatically. If you wish to customize the format for the field, turn this setting off. If Use default format is turned off, you can specify how the field should be formatted. For numeric fields, choose the desired format from the drop-down list of choices: . | Currency, 2 decimal places: this displays the currency symbol, the thousands separator, and two places after the decimal. The format string for this is “{0:c2}.” For example, 4132 formatted using this setting displays as $4,132.00 in North America and €4.132,00 in Germany. | Currency, no decimal places: this displays the currency symbol, the thousands separator, and whole numbers. The format string for this is “{0:c0}.” For example, 4132 formatted using this setting displays as $4,132 in North America and €4.132 in Germany. | Thousands separator, 2 decimal places: this displays the thousands separator and two places after the decimal. The format string for this is “{0:#,##0.00}.” For example, 4132 formatted using this setting displays as 4,132.00 in North America and 4.132,00 in Germany. | Thousands separator, 2 decimal places, blank if zero: this displays the thousands separator and two places after the decimal but displays as blank if the value is zero. The format string for this is “{0:#,##0.00;-#,##0.00;””}.” For example, 4132 formatted using this setting displays as 4,132.00 in North America and 4.132,00 in Germany. | Thousands separator, no decimal places: this displays the thousands separator and whole numbers. The format string for this is “{0:#,##0}.” For example, 4132 formatted using this setting displays as 4,132 in North America and 4.132 in Germany. | Thousands separator, no decimal places, blank if zero: this displays the thousands separator and whole numbers but displays as blank if the value is zero. The format string for this is “{0:#,##0;-#,##0;””}.” For example, 4132 formatted using this setting displays as 4,132 in North America and 4.132 in Germany. | Percentage, 2 decimal places: this displays a percentage to two decimal places. The format string for this is “{0:##0.00%}.” For example, 0.94 formatted using this setting displays as 94.00% in North America and 94,00% in Germany. | Percentage, no decimal places: this displays a percentage with no decimal places. The format string for this is “{0:##0%}.” For example, 0.94 formatted using this setting displays as 94% in both North America and Germany. | . You can also choose Custom/empty format. This allows you to enter a custom format string, which takes the form of “{0:format},” where format is a set of format symbols defining how the field is formatted. Commonly used format symbols are: . | Symbol | Description | . | cn | Displays the value using the currency settings based on the TopicLink([Locale],[_04A0XWFXE]) setting (for example, \"$\" as the currency symbol, \",\" as the thousands separator, and \".\" as the decimal separator in North America) and the number of decimal places specified as n. For example, 4132 formatted as c2 displays as $4,132.00 in North America and &#128;4.132,00 in Germany. | . | 0 | A place holder for a digit, padded with a zero if necessary. For example, 4132 formatted as 000000 displays as 004132. | . | # | A place holder for a digit, blank if necessary. For example, 4132 formatted as #####0 displays as 4132. | . | , | Displays the thousands separator symbol based on the Locale setting (for example, \",\" in North America). You only have to specify the character once, not once every three places. For example, 4132 formatted as #,##0 displays as 4,132 in North America and 4.132 in Germany. | . | . | Displays a decimal separator symbol based on the Locale setting (for example, \".\" in North America). For example, 4132 formatted as #,##0.00 displays as 4,132.00 in North America and 4.132,00 in Germany. | . | % | Multiplies the value by 100 and appends a percentage sign. For example, 0.132 formatted as ##0.00% displays as 13.20%. | . | dn | For a numeric value, left-pads the value with zeros. For example, 10 formatted as d6 displays as 000010. | . | d | For a date/time value, displays the value using the Short Date setting based on the Locale setting. For example, January 10, 2013 2:22:30 PM displays as 1/10/2013 in the U.S. and 10/01/2013 in France. | . | D | Displays a date/time value using the Long Date setting based on the Locale setting. For example, January 10, 2013 2:22:30 PM displays as Thursday, January 10, 2013 in the U.S. | . | g | Displays a date/time value using the Short Date setting based on the Locale setting, including the time without seconds. For example, January 10, 2013 2:22:30 PM displays as 1/10/2013 2:22 PM in the U.S. | . | G | Displays a date/time value using the Short Date setting based on the Locale setting, including the time with seconds. For example, January 10, 2013 2:22:30 PM displays as 1/10/2013 2:22:30 PM in the U.S. | . | t | Displays a date/time value using the Short Time setting based on the Locale setting.

For example, January 10, 2013 2:22:30 PM displays as 2:22:30 PM in the U.S. | . You can specify how positive, negative, and zero values are displayed by separating the three formats with semi-colons. For example, {0:#,##0.00;-#,##0.00;””} formats positive numbers as #,##0.00, negative numbers as -#,##0.00, and zero as blank. Other symbols can be used as well; see MSDN (such as http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0c899ak8.aspx, http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dwhawy9k.aspx, and http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/az4se3k1.aspx) . For date/time fields, the choices are shown in the following table. Note that not all choices are available for all types of reports; for example, Quarter is only available for cross-tab reports. | Format | Description | Example | . | Date | Displays only the date portion of the date. | 09/25/2015 | . | Date and time, 12 hour format | Displays the date and time in 12 hour format without seconds. | 09/25/2015 1:15 PM | . | Date and time, 12 hour format (seconds) | Displays the date and time in 12 hour format with seconds. | 09/25/2015 1:15:00 PM | . | Date and time, 24 hour format | Displays the date and time in 24 hour format without seconds. | 09/25/2015 13:15 | . | Date and time, 24 hour format (seconds) | Displays the date and time in 24 hour format with seconds. | 09/25/2015 13:15:00 | . | Time, 12 hour (HH:MM:SS) | Displays the time in 12 hour format with seconds. | 1:15:00 PM | . | Time, 12 hour (HH:MM) | Displays the time in 12 hour format without seconds. | 1:15 PM | . | Time, 24 hour (HH:MM:SS) | Displays the time in 24 hour format with seconds. | 13:15:00 | . | Time, 24 hour (HH:MM) | Displays the time in 24 hour format without seconds. | 13:15 | . | Day | Displays the day number. | 25 | . | Day of week | Displays the spelled-out day. | Friday | . | Abbreviated day of week | Displays the abbreviated spelled-out day. | Fri | . | Month | Displays the spelled-out month. | September | . | Abbreviated month | Displays the abbreviated spelled-out month. | Sep | . | Month/year | Displays the spelled-out month and year. | September 2015 | . | Abbreviated month/year | Displays the abbreviated spelled-out month and year. | Sep 2015 | . | Year | Displays the year. | 2015 | . | Hour | Displays the hour. | 10 | . | Quarter | Displays the quarter as a digit | 3 | . | Quarter/Year | Displays the quarter and year. | Q3 2015 | .

    "doc": "Formulas",
    "title": "Formulas",
    "content": "You may wish to add your own formulas to a report. For example, suppose you pay commissions of 5% of the sales amount. You could output a report showing sales amounts to a Microsoft Excel document and then add a formula that calculates 5% of the amount, but it would be easier and more convenient to do it in Horizon Reports by defining your own formula. There are two types of formulas: normal and grouping. A normal formula is one that calculates a value by evaluating an expression on each record. For example, a formula that calculates a 5% commission would have an expression something like “Amount * 0.05” and it would calculate that value for every record in the result set for a report. A grouping formula is more complicated. It calculates a value but it goes through a set of records, often from a different table than the formula goes in, matching a filter and performing a summarization. For example, suppose you want columns in a report that show the sales for last year and the current year-to-date for each customer. Those aren’t single values retrieved from the database. Instead, for the first column, use a grouping formula that sums up the sales records for each customer for last year, and use a similar one but for the current year for the second column. To create your own formulas, click the Create New Formula button in Step 2 of the report wizards or choose Formulas from the Tools menu and click the Create New Formula button in the Formulas dialog to bring up the Formula Editor. The Formula page has the following options: . | Formula type: select the type of formula to use. | Data group: the module to select a table from. Only those modules installed on your system and you have rights to appear. Choose “All” to select any tables for the formula, regardless of module. | Table: the table the formula appears in. | Name: the formula is automatically given an internal name starting with “CALC” which cannot be changed. It is displayed for information purposes only. | Caption: the name of the formula as displayed in field lists such as in the report wizards. Note that the caption is displayed with a “[Formula]” suffix in the report wizards so you can tell which fields are actually formulas. | Heading: the default column heading for the formula. This is normally the same as Caption but could be different, such as an abbreviation (“Comm. Amt.”). You can specify multiple lines for the heading by pressing Enter where a new line should start. | Comments: enter any comments you want displayed in the Comments page of the Field Properties dialog. | Tenant: this control, which only appears if you’re an administrative user, allows you to define which tenant the formula belongs to. Choose the desired tenant from the drop-down list or No tenant if the formula is available to all tenants. | Evaluation: set this to Evaluate formula expression internally if you use any functions the database engine doesn’t understand, such as the functions listed in the Expressions and Function Reference. In that case, Horizon Reports requests any fields used in the expression from the database engine and then evaluates the expression itself. Choose Send formula expression to database engine if the database engine evaluates the formula. This setting gives better performance. | . The Expression page has the following options: . | Data type: the data type for the formula’s result. This is normally filled in automatically after you’ve entered the formula, but you can change it if necessary. The choices are: . | Boolean: choose this for expressions that result in true or false (or yes or no) values. | DateTime: this is for date/time values. | Decimal: this is normally used for monetary values. The range of values supported is ±7.9 x 10-28 to ±7.9 x 1028). | Double: this is often used for non-monetary numeric values, as it has less precision but a bigger range than Decimal: ±5.0 x 10-324 to ±1.7 x 10308. | Int16: a 2-byte integer value. The range is -32,768 to 32,767. | Int32: a 4-byte integer value (the most common integer value). The range is -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. | Int64: an 8-byte integer value. The range is -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to -9,223,372,036,854,775,807. | String: choose this for text values. | . | Preview: click this button to test and preview the results of the expression. If there’s an error in the expression, an error message displays. Otherwise, the results of the expression from the first ten records of the specified table show in a preview window. Any fields involved in the expression are also displayed so you can check the accuracy of the expression. Note that you must preview a formula to confirm that it works before you can save it. If Data type isn’t set correctly, the Formula Editor changes it to the data type found after previewing. | . The controls below the Preview button form an expression builder, which helps to create the expression using friendly table and field names or available functions and expressions. In addition to being available for editing formulas, you can also use this interface to help build filter condition expressions, display expressions, and conditional format expressions. The first option in the expression builder is the expression for the formula. You can type the formula if you wish, but it’s much easier to use the expression builder controls (discussed later) instead. Note that formulas are displayed using real table and field names, another reason why it’s easier to edit them using the expression builder controls. Here’s an example of an expression that calculates a 5% commission of the sales amount: . Transaction.Amount * 0.05 The expression can contain any of the built-in functions; see the [Expressions and Function Reference](vfps://Topic/_16W0VJB34) topic for information on expression and the functions available to be used. Select the table to choose fields from with the Table control, then click the beside a field to add its real name to the end of the expression. You can also choose from either a list of functions built into Horizon Reports, or from a list of commonly used expressions. The Expression functions drop-down list shows the available function and the arguments each accepts. When you select one, information about the function is displayed below the list, including the data types of the return value and arguments and a description of the function. The commonly used expressions drop-down list gives a description of what the expression will evaluate to. Click the Insert Function button to insert the selected function or commonly used expression into the expression. The Formatting page has the following options: . | Default summary type: this setting specifies the default summary setting for the field in a report. For example, if this is set to Sum, when the field is added to a report, Horizon Reports automatically sums the field. | Format: the format to use for the field. See the Data Selection topic for details on formats. | . The Grouping page, which only appears if Formula type is set to Grouping formula, has the following options: . | Grouping filter: the filter conditions for the grouping formula. See the Selecting Which Records to Include topic and its sub-topics for information how filtering works. For example, suppose the formula calculates last year’s sales for each customer. In that case, the formula would go in the Customers table and the expression would be the Amount field from the Orders table. The filter condition would be on the Order Date field, use the is between operator, have Compare To set to Expression and use as the two values “Date(Year(Now()) - 1, 1, 1)” and “Date(Year(Now()) - 1, 12, 31)”. The first expression gives January 1 of the previous year: the Now() function gives the current date, Year(SomeDate) gives the year of the specified date, subtracting 1 from the year gives the previous year, and Date(Year, Month, Day) gives January 1 of that year. The second expression is similar but gives December 31 of the previous year. | Grouping fields: the fields used to group the data on to create the final value. Click the button to add a field to the selected list; click to remove a field from the selected list. Continuing the previous example, the grouping field should be Customer ID because that’s what the totals are calculated for: each customer by their ID. | Summary type: the type of summarization to do to the data to create the final value. The choices are Sum, Average, Highest, Lowest, Count, Count Distinct, or Concatenate. Sum and Average are only available for numeric fields. The difference between Count and Count Distinct is that Count counts the number of records while Count Distinct counts the number of records having unique values in this field. For example, if there are 100 order records but all orders were placed this week, using Count on the Order Date field would display 100 but Count Distinct would display 7 (assuming at least one order was placed every day this week). Concatenate is used for text fields when you want to combine the values of several records into a single, comma-separated value in one record. For example, suppose you want to show which products each customer purchased. If you add the customer name and product name to the report, you’ll see one record for every purchase a customer made, so there may be many records for each customer. If you only want each customer to appear once, create a grouping formula in the customers table with an expression of the product name, Summary set to Concatenate, and Grouping fields set to the customer number. Now, when you add company name and this formula to the report, you’ll see each customer just once with a list of the products they purchased. Choose the desired function from the drop-down list, or None for no summary value. In the example discussed above, this should be set to Sum. | . The Security page allows you to define the permissions for the formula. This page is only available for Administrator and Tenant Administrator users. To specify that members of a role can use the formula but not edit or delete it, drag the role from the Available roles list to the Roles with read permission list. To specify that members of a role can use, edit, or delete the formula, drag the role from the Available roles list to the Roles with full permission list. To remove permissions for a role, drag it back to the Available roles list; members of that role cannot see or use the formula. The Administrator role doesn’t appear in any list because members of that role have full permission to all formulas. To save the formula, click the button, which is only enabled after the Caption and Expression settings are filled in. Click to cancel. To see all of the formulas you’ve defined, choose Formulas from the Tools menu. This dialog shows a list of the formulas you’ve defined. Beside each formula name is the number of reports using that formula; hover your mouse over the number to see the names of the reports. To add a new formula, click Create New Formula. To edit a formula, click the button beside its name. Click Copy to copy the formula to a new one. The button removes a formula. ",

Note that dimensions are either in inches (shown as “in”) or centimeters (shown as “cm”), depending on the units you selected in the Options dialog. The options in this step are: . | Edit Advanced Layout: click this button to create and edit the advanced layout for the report. | Delete Advanced Layout: click this button, which is only enabled if the report has an advanced layout, to remove the advanced layout from the report. | Advanced Report Properties: click this button to display the Advanced Report Properties dialog so you can change some advanced settings. This button is disabled if you haven’t selected any fields for the report. | Label type: choose the desired label type from the drop-down list of choices. Note that if you choose a label that isn’t tall enough for the fields in the report (for example, the report has eight fields but you specify a 1 inch high label which can only accommodate six lines), the text in the label is cut off. Be sure to preview the report to ensure you’ve selected the correct label size. A rule of thumb to use is that labels print six lines per inch. Once you’ve chosen the label type, the dimensions of the label are filled in automatically. You can tweak the layout if you wish by adjusting these values. | Label width: the width of one label. | Label height: the height of one label. | Vertical pitch: the distance from the left edge of one label to the left edge of the label beside it. | Horizontal pitch: the distance from the top edge of one label to the top edge of the label below it. | Paper type: you can choose from the drop-down list of all standard paper types, such as letter, legal, and A4. | Left margin: the distance from the left edge of the page to the first label. | Top margin: the distance from the top edge of the page to the first label. | Table layout: by default, Horizon Reports uses absolute positioning to render a report in the Preview window. While that normally works well, if you find that some objects aren’t positioned properly, you may wish to use HTML tables to render the report instead. In that case, turn this setting on. | Always run: turn this option on to run the report even when there are no records that match your filter condition. This results in a blank report. If this option is turned off, rather than displaying a blank report, Horizon Reports displays a message that there are no records. | Distinct: if you filter on a field from a table that isn’t involved in the report, you may end up with what appear to be duplicate records. For example, say your report displays the Company Name and Contact Name from the Customers table. If you filter on the Product Name from the Products table being “Apricot Jam” (in other words, you want a list of customers who bought that product), you’d end up with each customer showing up once for every order they placed for that product. So, if Sam’s Grocery ordered it 25 times, they’d appear on the report 25 times. That isn’t typically something you’d want, so Horizon Reports can eliminate these duplicate records for you. The DISTINCT clause in a SQL statement tells the database to only find records that have distinct values, so adding that clause to the SQL statement means that Sam’s Grocery only shows up once. The Retrieve distinct records option allows you to control whether the DISTINCT clause is used or not. “Never” means don’t add a DISTINCT clause to the SQL statement for this report and “Always” means do add it. “If filtering on a table not in the report” means only add the DISTINCT clause if you filter on a field from a table that isn’t involved in the report. You might think that “If filtering on a table not in the report” should always be used. However, there may be times when this isn’t the correct behavior. For example, if you want to show fields from the Orders table (Order Date, Product Name, and Quantity Ordered) but filter on Company Name is “Sam’s Grocery,” Horizon Reports eliminates what it thinks are duplicate records, such as two orders for the same product and same quantity on the same day. Clearly, this isn’t right—you’d end up with some missing data. In that case, set this option to Never. | Top N: this option allows you to display only the top records. If you set this option to something other than “No,” you can enter a number and indicate whether that number is the number of records you want (the “Count” setting) or a percentage of the total records such as the top 10 percent (the “Percent” setting). Note that “top” refers to the sort order for the report. For example, if the report is sorted alphabetically by Company Name, you’ll get the specified number of records in alphabetical order. If the report is sorted in descending by Order Date, you get the specified number of most recent orders. | . ",

Note that you must type the real field name, not the descriptive name, and any fields you reference in the condition must be included in the report. If you don’t want those fields to appear, turn off Display in report for those fields. | Use default foreground color: If this is turned off, you can specify the foreground color to use if the expression is true. If the setting is turned on, the foreground color of the field or template is used in all cases (even if the expression is true). | Use default background color: If this is turned off, you can specify the background color to use if the expression is true. If the setting is turned on, the background color of the field or template is used in all cases (even if the expression is true). | Font: the font name, size, and style to use if the expression is true. If the expression is false, the font settings of the field or template are used. | . You can create as many conditional formats as you wish. Click the button to remove a conditional format. | . The Link page allows you to link the selected field to an email dialog or a web site. A linked field appears as a hyperlink in the report Preview window. When you click a linked field in the Preview window, one of a couple of things happens: . | For email links, the New Message dialog of your email program is brought up with the email address already filled in. | For web site links, another tab in your web browser opens and navigates to the web site. | .

For example, you may wish to have a report sorted by city and within city, chronologically by a certain date field. There are three types of sorting: . | Grouping: this sorts the data in the report by the different values of the grouped field. For example, if the report shows invoices grouped by customer name, all of the invoices for each customer appear together. Groups have three sections: a group header which shows the current group value (such as the name of the customer), the detail lines for that group (for example, the invoices), and a group footer, which shows summary information for the group (such as the number of invoices and the total amount for that customer). The groups are sorted by the grouped field (for example, invoices for Alfreds Futterkiste come before those for Consolidated Holdings) unless there’s a group sort field. | Group sorting: this sorts the data by the summary value of a field within a group. For example, suppose the report is grouped by customer and group sorted by invoice amount. In that case, all of the invoices for each customer appear together but the groups are sorted by the total of the invoices for the customers. In that case, invoices for Consolidated Holdings might come before those for Alfreds Futterkiste if Consolidated Holdings total sales are greater. | Sorting: this sorts the data by the specified field. If there’s no grouping for a report, sorting is the only way the report is ordered. For example, if the report is sorted by invoice date, invoices are shown in chronological order. If there is grouping, sorting takes place within a group. For example, if the report shows invoices grouped by customer name and sorted by invoice date, the groups are sorted by customer, all of the invoices for each customer appear together, and the invoices are in chronological order. | .

    "title": "Step 5 Report Options",

The options in this step are: . | Edit Advanced Layout: click this button to create and edit the advanced layout for the report. | Delete Advanced Layout: click this button, which is only enabled if the report has an advanced layout, to remove the advanced layout from the report. | Subreport Properties: click this button to display the Subreport Properties dialog so you can define subreports for this report. This button is disabled if you haven’t selected any fields for the report. | Advanced Report Properties: click this button to display the Advanced Report Properties dialog so you can change some advanced settings. This button is disabled if you haven’t selected any fields for the report. | Title: the title for the report. The title, which defaults to whatever you entered for Name, appears at the top of every page of the report. If you want to use an expression rather than fixed text, surround the expression with “{“ and “}” (without the quotes). Note that the expression must evaluate to a string value, so use the Str() function if necessary to convert non-string values such as dates and numbers to their string equivalent. Here’s an example of an expression that displays “Sales for \" (such as \"Sales for December 2015\") in the report header: . {\"Sales for \" + MonthName(Now()) + \" \" + Str(Year(Now()))} . Suppose the report has an ask-at-runtime condition on Country and you want to display “Sales for country” in the title, where country is the country chosen by the user when they run the report. In that case, use the GetConditionValue function: . {\"Sales for \" + GetConditionValue(0, 0)} . This expression displays the name of the report and the data source it reports on. {Name + \"\\n\" + DataSource} . (The “\\n” is a line break.) . | Orientation: the default choice, Automatic, means that if the report is too wide to fit in portrait orientation, it automatically switches to landscape. However, you can override this by choosing either Portrait or Landscape to force the report to be printed in the desired orientation. | Template: this specifies the template, which determines the overall layout of the report. The default template for a new report is determined by the Default template setting in the Options dialog, but if other templates are available, you may select the desired one from the drop-down list. Note that if your report contains Unicode characters, you may wish to use a “Unicode” template or the report may not display the characters properly when output to PDF. | Paper type: if this option is turned on, which it is by default, the paper type defined in the template is used for the report. Turn this off to use a different paper type, which you can choose from the drop-down list. All standard paper types, such as letter, legal, and A4, are supported. Note that if you choose Custom for the paper type, you can enter the height and width of the custom type. | Margin: these options control the left, right, top, and bottom margins of the report. If these options are turned on, which they are by default, the margins defined in the template are used for the report. Turn these off individually to use a different margin. | Localize: if this option is turned on, which it is by default, the report is “localized” when it’s run. Localizing a report meaning translating column headings and other things like “Page 1 of 2” into the language the user running the reports has chosen in the Options dialog. If you turn this option off, the report is run with these things in the language the report was created in. | Table layout: by default, Horizon Reports uses absolute positioning to render a report in the Preview window. While that normally works well, if you find that some objects aren’t positioned properly, you may wish to use HTML tables to render the report instead. In that case, turn this setting on. | Respect page width: if this option is turned on, which it is by default, and you add more fields that can fit on one row in a report, any fields extending beyond the right edge are automatically moved to the next row. That allows you to see all of the data but gets kind of messy. If you turn this option off, fields are allowed to extend beyond the right edge. In that case, moving to the next page in the Preview window shows those fields. Here’s an example with Respect page width turned on: . Here’s the first page of the report with this setting turned off. Notice that not all of the fields are shown. Here’s the second page. Notice that it shows the rest of the fields. | Auto fit to page: this setting, which only appears when Respect page width is turned off, helps with the issue shown in the image above. Turn this on to scale the data down so it fits on one horizontal page rather than taking more than one page. | Move subtotals: this setting allows you to control where subtotals are placed if they’re too close to the left margin. With this setting turned on (the default), subtotal values that overlap with the subtotal label are moved to the next row; for example: . With the setting turned off, the subtotal label is narrowed and may span several rows if necessary so the subtotal value can appear on the first row; for example: . | Database in Header: turn this option on to display the name of the database the report is being run against in the header of the report. | Group totals: by default, group totals are shown in the group footer (the “After Values” setting). Set this to “Before Values” to show totals in the group header instead. | Always run: turn this option on to run the report even when there are no records that match your filter condition. This results in a blank report. If this option is turned off, rather than displaying a blank report, Horizon Reports displays a message that there are no records. | Summary report: if this item is turned on, the report does not print detail information but only those fields that appear in group headers and summarized fields. This option is disabled unless there’s at least one group in the report. | Distinct: if you filter on a field from a table that isn’t involved in the report, you may end up with what appear to be duplicate records. For example, say your report displays the Company Name and Contact Name from the Customers table. If you filter on the Product Name from the Products table being “Apricot Jam” (in other words, you want a list of customers who bought that product), you’d end up with each customer showing up once for every order they placed for that product. So, if Sam’s Grocery ordered it 25 times, they’d appear on the report 25 times. That isn’t typically something you’d want, so Horizon Reports can eliminate these duplicate records for you. The DISTINCT clause in a SQL statement tells the database to only find records that have distinct values, so adding that clause to the SQL statement means that Sam’s Grocery only shows up once. The Retrieve distinct records option allows you to control whether the DISTINCT clause is used or not. “Never” means don’t add a DISTINCT clause to the SQL statement for this report and “Always” means do add it. “If filtering on a table not in the report” means only add the DISTINCT clause if you filter on a field from a table that isn’t involved in the report. You might think that “If filtering on a table not in the report” should always be used. However, there may be times when this isn’t the correct behavior. For example, if you want to show fields from the Orders table (Order Date, Product Name, and Quantity Ordered) but filter on Company Name is “Sam’s Grocery,” Horizon Reports eliminates what it thinks are duplicate records, such as two orders for the same product and same quantity on the same day. Clearly, this isn’t right—you’d end up with some missing data. In that case, set this option to Never. | Top N: this option allows you to display only the top records. If you set this option to something other than “No,” you can enter a number and indicate whether that number is the number of records you want (the “Count” setting) or a percentage of the total records such as the top 10 percent (the “Percent” setting). Note that “top” refers to the sort order for the report. For example, if the report is sorted alphabetically by Company Name, you’ll get the specified number of records in alphabetical order. If the report is sorted in descending by Order Date, you get the specified number of most recent orders. | . ",

For example, suppose you have a customer report and you’ve added as a subreport a report showing sales by customer. The subreport has an ask-at-runtime filter condition on the customer number, so for each company, the subreport runs and asks you for the customer number. That seems odd, because it’s supposed to be for the customer shown in the report and now it wants you to specify which customer. To make this more seamless, you want to tell the subreport which customer to use. You do that by specifying what value to pass to the ask-at-runtime filter condition of the subreport. In this case, you’d specify that the customer number should be passed to the subreport. Since that value is passed, the report doesn’t need to ask you for the customer number, and simply displays the sales for each customer.

The choices for the Type column are: . | Filter Condition, which means this report contains the same ask-at-runtime filter condition as the subreport, and you want the value you specify when you run this report passed to the subreport. For example, if both reports have an ask-at-runtime filter condition on the order date, you’d want to use the same order date range you specify when you run this report used for the subreport. So, choose Filter Condition and select the field used for the condition in the Value to pass drop-down list. | Field, which means you want to pass the value of the field specified in the Value to pass column for the current record. For example, for each customer in the report, you want to pass the customer number to the ask-at-runtime filter condition on customer number to the subreport, so choose Field and select the Customer Number field in the Value to pass drop-down list. | Ignore this condition, which means you want to ignore this condition (that is, act like you clicked the Ignore this condition option in the filter value dialog) and not display the dialog asking you for the value for this condition. | . Note that only fields selected for the report appear in the list of fields in the Value to pass drop-down list, so be sure to include the desired field in the report. If you don’t want that field to actually appear in the report, turn off the Display in report setting for that field. ",

    "title": "Tags",
    "content": "Tags allow you to categorize a report. You can mark a report as being a management report, a weekly report, a favorite report, and one of your reports. You do that by assigning as many tags to the report as you wish. Reports are displayed in the Reports Explorer grouped by tag. If a report has more than one tag, it’ll appear in more than one group. A tag can be a sub-tag of another tag. For example, you may have a Management Reports tag with Daily, Weekly, and Monthly sub-tags. Sub-tags appear within the section for the parent tag. Tags can be dynamic. A dynamic tag is one that you don’t add to a report; in fact, dynamic tags don’t even appear in the list of tags you can add to a report. Instead, all reports that match a certain criteria automatically belong to that tag. For example, you might have a dynamic tag that’s for all reports you created. One dynamic tag that’s built-in and can’t be edited or deleted is called “All Reports.” All reports automatically use this tag. The main purpose of the All Reports tag is to provide a place for reports you didn’t tag to be displayed. You can manage tags using the Tags dialog, which you can access using the Tags function in the Tools menu. Note that depending on how security is set up, the Tags dialog may not be available to all users. The list shows which tags have already been defined and buttons to edit, copy and delete them. There’s also a column of values that shows how many reports each tag has been assigned to. To add a tag, click the Create New Tag button. To edit the properties of a tag, click Edit button for the tag. The properties for a tag are: . | Tag name: the name of the tag. | Parent tag: the parent tag this is a sub-tag of. Leave it blank it it’s a top-level tag. This property isn’t available for dynamic tags. | Expression: the expression to use for a dynamic tag; leave this blank for a regular tag. You can use any valid expression, including built-in functions. For example, this expression includes any report created or modified in the last five days: . DateDiff(Now(), Report.CreatedAt) &lt;= 5 or DateDiff(Now(), Report.ModifiedAt) &lt;= 5 . The Now function gives today’s date and the DateDiff function determines the number of days between two dates. CreatedAt and ModifiedAt are properties of reports containing the date a report was created and modified, respectively. Properties are specified using “Report.PropertyName”, where PropertyName is the name of the property. So, DateDiff(Now(), Report.CreatedAt) is the number of days between today and when the report was created, and DateDiff(Now(), Report.CreatedAt) &lt;= 5 is true if the number of days is less than or equal to 5. Here’s another expression: . Report.CreatedBy = \"BJONES\" . This tag is automatically used by any report created by a user named BJONES. | Tenant: this control, which only appears if you’re an administrative user, allows you to define which tenant the tag belongs to. Choose the desired tenant from the drop-down list or choose No tenant if the tag is available to all tenants. | . To specify that members of a role can view this tag and assign it to reports, drag the role from the Available roles list to the Roles that can access this tag list. To remove permissions for a role, drag it back to the Available roles list; members of that role cannot see the tag or assign it to reports. The Administrator role doesn’t appear in any list because members of that role have full permission to all reports. To delete a tag, click the Delete button for the tag. This doesn’t delete any reports; it just removes that tag from any reports that use it. ",

    "doc": "Templates",
    "title": "Template components",
    "content": "A template has two types of components that define how a report looks: styles and objects. Styles are like style sheets in Microsoft Word: they define how objects of a certain type should look (font, color, and so on). Objects specify which styles are used by certain fields and which fixed objects should appear in the report, such as lines, boxes, image, etc. There are templates that come with Horizon Reports for both quick and cross-tab reports. Quick report templates . The quick report templates that come with Horizon Reports have the following styles: . | ColumnHeadingStyle: used by column headings, such as the Column Heading Template object in the picture above. | DetailBandFieldStyle: used by fields in the detail band, such as the Detail Band Field Template object in the picture above. | DetailBandFieldStyleEven: used by fields in the even-numbered rows of the detail band if it exists. | DetailBandFieldStyleOdd: used by fields in the odd-numbered rows of the detail band if it exists. | GroupCountStyle: used by group counts in the group footer bands. | GroupFieldStyle1: used by grouped fields in the lowest level group header, such as the Group Field Template object in the lower group footer band in the picture above. | GroupFieldStyle2: used by grouped fields in the highest level group header, such as the Group Field Template object in the upper group footer band in the picture above. | GroupFooterStyle: used by the “Totals for” object in a group footer band, such as the Group Footer Template object in the picture above. | GroupFooterSummaryFieldStyle: used by summary fields in a group footer band, such as the Group Footer object in the picture above. | GroupHeadingStyle1: used by the heading for grouped fields in the lowest level group header, such as the Group Heading object in the lower group header band in the picture above. | GroupHeadingStyle2: used by the heading for grouped fields in the highest level group header, such as the Group Heading object in the upper group header band in the picture above. | HyperlinkStyle: used by linked fields such as for drill downs. | SummaryFieldStyle: used by summary fields at the end of the report, such as the Summary Field object in the ReportFooter band in the picture above. | . See the Styles help topic for information on how styles work in the Layout Designer. The templates that come with Horizon Reports have the following objects: . | Title: displays the value of the ReportTitle parameter, which contains the title of the report. Its Tag property contains “PageFill,” which means its width is expanded to fill the page. | Filter: displays the value of the ReportFilter parameter, which contains the filter of the report. Its Tag property also contains “PageFill.” . | Date: displays the current date. | PageNumber: displays the current page number and total page count (for example, “Page 3 of 5”). Its Tag property contains “PageRight,” meaning it’s moved to the right edge of the page. | ColumnHeadingPanel: a panel that acts as a container for column headings. Its vertical position determines the location of column headings and its Tag property contains “ColumnHeadingPanel,” which is how Horizon Reports knows it’s a placeholder for column headings. Its Style property is set to “ColumnHeadingStyle.” . | ColumnHeadingTemplate: a placeholder for column headings. It’s placed inside ColumnHeadingPanel. If it isn’t located within a panel, its vertical position determines the location of column headings within the panel; otherwise, the panel determines that. Its Tag property contains “ColumnHeadingTemplate,” which is how Horizon Reports knows it’s a placeholder for column headings. Its Style property is set to “ColumnHeadingStyle.” If this placeholder isn’t defined in a template, then any reports using it won’t have column headers. | GroupHeadingPanel: a panel that acts as a container for grouped field headings. Its vertical position determines the location of grouped field headings and its Tag property contains “GroupHeadingPanel,” which is how Horizon Reports knows it’s a placeholder for grouped field headings. Its Style property is set to “GroupHeadingStyle.” There may be more than one of these; in that case, both Name and Tag are numbered (such as GroupHeadingPanel2) and Style is set to the appropriate style (such as GroupHeadingStyle2). The higher the number, the higher the group header band it’s associated with. For example, if you’ve grouped on Company Name and within that on Order Date, GroupHeadingPanel2 is used for Company Name and GroupHeadingPanel1 is used for Order Date. If there are more than two grouped fields and only two group heading templates, GroupHeadingPanel1 is used for the third and subsequent group headings. | GroupHeadingTemplate: a placeholder for grouped field headings. It’s placed inside GroupHeadingPanel. Its horizontal and vertical position determines the location of grouped field headings and its Tag property contains “GroupHeadingTemplate.” Its Style property is set to “GroupHeadingStyle”. As with GroupHeadingPanel, there may be more than one of these and the same concepts apply. | GroupFieldTemplate: a placeholder for grouped fields. It’s placed inside GroupHeadingPanel. Its horizontal and vertical position determines the location of grouped fields and its Tag property contains “GroupFieldTemplate.” Its Style property is set to “GroupFieldStyle”. As with GroupHeadingPanel, there may be more than one of these and the same concepts apply. | DetailBandFieldTemplate: a placeholder for detail fields. Its position isn’t important but its Tag property contains “DetailBandFieldTemplate.” Its Style property is set to “DetailBandFieldStyle”. | GroupFooterTemplate: a placeholder for the “Totals for” object in a group footer band. Its horizontal and vertical position determines the location of these objects and its Tag property contains “GroupFooterTemplate.” Its Style property is set to “GroupFooterStyle”. As with GroupHeadingTemplate, there may be more than one of these and the same concepts apply. | GroupFooterSummaryFieldTemplate: a placeholder for summary fields in a group footer band. Its horizontal and vertical position determines the location of these objects and its Tag property contains “GroupFooterSummaryFieldTemplate.” Its Style property is set to “GroupFooterSummaryFieldStyle”. As with GroupHeadingTemplate, there may be more than one of these and the same concepts apply. | RecordCount: displays the record count at the end of the report. | SummaryFieldTemplate: a placeholder for summary fields at the end of the report. Its position isn’t important but its Tag property contains “SummaryFieldTemplate.” Its Style property is set to “SummaryFieldStyle”. | . A template may have other objects as well. For example, the Standard template has lines above and below the column headings and a line above the summary fields in the ReportFooter band. The Professional - Blue template, shown in the picture above, has panels in the PageHeader and GroupHeader bands that contain the placeholder objects and a line about the summary fields in the ReportFooter band. Cross-tab report templates . The cross-tab report templates that come with Horizon Reports have the following styles: . | ColumnHeadingStyle: used by column headings. | DetailBandFieldStyle: used by data fields in the detail band. | DetailBandFieldStyleEven: used by fields in the even-numbered rows of the detail band if it exists. | DetailBandFieldStyleOdd: used by fields in the odd-numbered rows of the detail band if it exists. | HeaderControlsStyle: used by objects in the page header, such as the title and date. | HyperlinkStyle: used by linked fields such as for drill downs. | RowHeadingStyle: used by row fields if it exists. | RowHeadingStyle1: used by the first row field if it exists. | RowHeadingStyle2: used by the second row field if it exists. | . See the Styles help topic for information on how styles work in the Layout Designer. The cross-tab templates that come with Horizon Reports have the following objects: . | Title: displays the value of the ReportTitle parameter, which contains the title of the report. Its Tag property contains “PageFill,” which means its width is expanded to fill the page. | Filter: displays the value of the ReportFilter parameter, which contains the filter of the report. Its Tag property also contains “PageFill.” . | Date: displays the current date. | PageNumber: displays the current page number and total page count (for example, “Page 3 of 5”). Its Tag property contains “PageRight,” meaning it’s moved to the right edge of the page. | ColumnHeadingPanel: a panel that acts as a placeholder for column headings. Its vertical position determines the location of column headings and its Tag property contains “ColumnHeadingPanel,” which is how Horizon Reports knows it’s a placeholder for column headings. Its Style property is set to “ColumnHeadingStyle.” . | . A template may have other objects as well. For example, the CrossTab Elegant template has a line above the grand totals. Since grand totals are treated like any other line in the detail band of the report, a formatting rule called VisibleForTotalRule is used so it’s only visible for the grand totals row. The condition for that rule is [ROWFIELD]=’Grand total’. [ROWFIELD] is automatically replaced with the name of the row field, so the rule only takes effect when that field contains “Grand total”. The line’s Tag property contains “DataFill,” which means its width is expanded to match that of the data. You can also use rules to format the data for the grand totals row differently. If a rule named DetailRule exists, it’s automatically applied to rows in the cross-tab. The CrossTab Elegant template has this rule use a bold font when [ROWFIELD]=’Grand total’. ",

For example, here’s a report using the Standard template: . Here’s the same report with the only change being switching the template to Professional - Blue: . Horizon Reports comes with several built-in templates; they appear in the Template drop-down list in step 5 of the report wizards. These templates can be found in the Templates subdirectory of the App_Data subdirectory of the Horizon Reports program folder. The template selected by default for a new report is the one specified by the Default template setting in the Options dialog. However, you aren’t restricted to using these templates. You can use the Template Editor to edit the supplied templates or create your own. Click the Templates menu item under the tools menu to nagivate to a template management interface.

Template layouts are edited using the same Layout Designer window that the Advanced Report Designer tool uses; see the Advanced Report Designer topic for details. You can add rectangles, lines, pictures (such as a company logo), and so forth. The objects in the template appear on every report using that template. You can also specify the paper size. However, due to its nature, there are a few differences between a template and a normal report: . | Some objects in a template are placeholders, which indicate where a particular object in a normal report is placed and how it’s formatted. For example, in the picture above, the Detail Band Field Template object is a placeholder specifying how fields in the Detail band of the report appear and Group Field Template is a placeholder for grouped fields. In some cases, if a placeholder object isn’t defined in the template, the corresponding object in the normal report also won’t appear. | Some objects need to be moved or resized as the report width adjusts based on the number of fields that appear in the report. For example, the [ReportTitle] object stretches horizontally so it’s as wide as the report and the Page Number object is moved to the right so it’s at the right edge of the report. | . @icon-info-circle If you add an image to a template, the image file must exist in Horizon Reports’s folder structure.

    "content": "Horizon Reports is licensed on a per-user basis. That means each user who wants to create and/or run reports requires a license. Here’s how licensing works: . | Until Horizon Reports has been activated, it runs in “unactivated” mode. You can use it this way for up to 30 days after the first time it was run. To activate the software, use the License Manager to add a license. | Licensing information is stored in a file named SFQuery.lic in the Licenses subdirectory of the program folder. | There are two types of licenses: Report Designer and Report Viewer. A Report Designer license allows a user to create new reports, edit reports, and copy reports. With a Report Viewer license, the user can only run reports. | There’s a subset of these license types: Subscription. A normal license can be used even if your software maintenance expires because you’ve purchased the software. A subscription license, on the other hand, isn’t purchased outright but is instead paid for on a subscription basis similar to subscribing to a magazine. If you stop making subscription payments, the license becomes inactive and you can no longer use the software. | Users in the Administrator role (such as the ADMIN user) are the only ones who have access to the Security dialog. In that dialog, an administrative user can define user names and specify which users use which license type. For example, Mary may be assigned a Report Designer license while Bob gets a Report Viewer license. | When you log in, Horizon Reports does two checks. The first is how many users are currently running Horizon Reports. If all licenses are currently in use (for example, five users are currently in Horizon Reports and there are five licenses in total), you are informed of this and returned to the Login page. The second check is whether another user is logged in with the same user name. If so, you are informed of this and returned to the Login page. So, Horizon Reports licensing is sometime called “concurrent use” because only as many users as there are licenses can be logged in at the same time. | . The Setup function in the Tools menu, which is only available for users in the Administrator role, can be used to manage licenses. ",

This can be caused by a lot of things, some of which you likely can’t control (such as a busy network, a slow network, etc.) and others you can. Note that rendering a lot of pages can take some time, so try using a filter that returns a smaller set of records. Horizon Reports seems slow loading reports after I log in. If you have a lot of reports (hundreds or even thousands), it can take a little while to load all those reports. A few things you can do to improve performance are: . | Close the “All reports” tag so it doesn’t have to load every single report after you log in. | Close other report tags so they aren’t open. | Use Google Chrome as your browser; it’s much faster than Microsoft Internet Explorer and Firefox. | If a view of all reports is necessary, use Flat View since performance is better. | If you’re using Internet Explorer, make sure your browser isn’t displaying the site in Compatibility View. To change that, choose the Tools (gear) icon, select “Compatibility View Settings,” and turn off “Display intranet sites in compatibility view.” . | .

However, when I output to PDF, they appear as boxes. Unicode characters are only displayed properly when the font contains appropriate glyphs (/assets/images/ that represent characters). Thus, you need to use a font, such as Arial Unicode MS or MS Gothic, whicht contains all the necessary glyphs for the desired language. You can use one of the “Unicode” templates, which use Arial Unicode MS, or create your own template. If you’re interested in reading about glyphs, see the Character sets and codepages article on the Microsoft web site. I’m getting an “unknown error” when trying to activate my license.

I want a report that’s just one long page. In step 5 of the report wizard, turn off Use template paper type, set the paper type to Custom, and enter a large value for Height, such as 100000. The layout of my report doesn’t look quite right: some things aren’t in the correct location. By default, Horizon Reports uses absolute positioning to render a report in the Preview window. While that normally works well, under some conditions, you may wish to use HTML tables instead. In that case, turn off the Use table layout setting in step 5 of the report wizard. ",

    "title": "Operators",
    "content": "Horizon Reports supports the four basic arithmetic operators—addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/)—as well as the modulus (%) and power (^) operators. (In case you’ve forgotten, the modulus operator divides one numeric value by another and returns the remainder; 99 % 5 is 4). Here’s an example: . a*2 + b^2 - 99%5 . If a is 5 and b is 3, the result is 15: 5*2 (10) + b^2 (9) - 99%5 (4). The four comparison operators—equals (=), not equals (&lt;&gt;), less than (&lt;), and greater than (&gt;)—are supported as well. Horizon Reports supports the And, Or, Xor, and Not operators for both logical and bitwise operations. If both operands are Boolean values, the operation is logical. If both are integers, the operation is bitwise. Any other combination results in an error. Here’s an example of a logical operation: . a &gt; 100 And Not b = 100 . If a is 150 and b is 3, the result is true. Here’s a bitwise operation: . (100 Or 2) And 1 . The result is 0. The left (&lt;) and right (&gt;) shift operators do a bitwise shift and are only valid on integers. For example: . 100 &gt; 2 . gives 25. The + operator also serves as the string concatenation operator. It is valid even if only one operand is a string; the non-string operand is automatically converted to a string. For example: . \"abc\" + \"def\" \"the number is: \" + 100 . The syntax for the indexing operator is memberName[indexExpression], where memberName is the name of a member of the Report class. Any expression can appear inside the brackets. Here’s an example: . MyArray[i + 1] + 100 . The in operator returns true if a value is contained within a set of items. Its syntax is either: . VALUE in (ITEM1, ITEM2, ... ) . or . VALUE in COLLECTION . where COLLECTION is an array or implements the .NET ICollection, IDictionary&lt;K,V&gt;, IList, or IDictionary interfaces. For example, if SomeDate is March 15, 2004, Month(SomeDate) in (1, 2, 3) returns true (the Month function returns the month number of the specified date). ",

    "title": "Functions",
    "content": "Functions are specified as the function name (note that function names are case-insensitive) followed by left and right parentheses. Arguments (values for the function to work on) may be specified inside the parentheses, and may be literal values, fields from a database, or another expression (such as Year(Now())). There are many functions built into Horizon Reports. These functions are very similar to the equivalent functions in Microsoft Excel, in terms of the function names, the arguments they take, and the values they return. There are also functions that have the same names as those in earlier versions of Horizon Reports for backward compatibility. Here is a list of the functions built into Horizon Reports. Abs( NUMERIC_VALUE ) . Returns the absolute value of the specified numeric expression. Abs(-6.5) returns 6.5. AddDays( DATE_VALUE, NUMERIC_VALUE ) . Adds the specified number of days to the specified date. If Orders.OrderDate is January 1, 2014, AddDays(Orders.OrderDate, 15) returns January 16, 2014. AllTrim( STRING ) This function is the same as Trim and is provided for backward compatibility. AScan( ARRAY, VALUE ) This function is the same as Match, although the order of the arguments is reversed, and is provided for backward compatibility. At( STRING_TO_FIND, STRING_TO_SEARCH_IN ) Returns the position at which STRING_TO_FIND is found within STRING_TO_SEARCH_IN or -1 if it isn’t found. The position is zero-based, so Find returns 0 if STRING_TO_FIND is found at the start of STRING_TO_SEARCH_IN. At is case-sensitive; use the Atc function for case-insensitive searches. At(“soft”, “Microsoft”) returns 5 and At(“soft”, “MicroSoft”) returns -1 (because of the capital “S”). At(“Micro”, “Microsoft”) returns 0 while At(“mega”, “Microsoft”) returns -1. Atc( STRING_TO_FIND, STRING_TO_SEARCH_IN ) A case-insensitive version of At. Atc(“soft”, “Microsoft”) and At(“soft”, “MicroSoft”) both return 5. Cast( VALUE, TYPE ) Converts an expression from one data type to another. The acceptable entries for the TYPE parameter are bool, byte, char, int, decimal, and double, specified without quotes. Cast(Customers.Type, int) returns 5 if Customers.Type contains the string “5.” . Ceiling( NUMERIC_VALUE ) Returns the next highest integer that is greater than or equal to the specified value. If SomeValue is 17.6, Ceiling(SomeValue) returns 18. Char( INTEGER_VALUE ) Returns a string containing the character whose numeric ASCII code is the argument. The argument must be between 0 and 255. Char(65) returns “A.” . Chr( INTEGER_VALUE ) This function is the same as Char and is provided for backward compatibility. CMonth( DATE_VALUE ) This function is the same as MonthName and is provided for backward compatibility. CToD( VALUE ) This function is the same as DateValue and is provided for backward compatibility. Date( YEAR, MONTH, DAY) Converts the year, month, and day (which are specified as numeric values) into a date value. Date(2004, 3, 30) returns March 30, 2004 as a date. Date() This function is the same as Now and is provided for backward compatibility. DateDiff( END_DATE, START_DATE ) Returns the number of days between the specified dates. If SomeDate1 is March 30, 2004 and SomeDate2 is April 1, 2004, DateDiff(SomeDate2, SomeDate1) gives 2. DateValue( VALUE ) Converts the specified string into a DateTime value. If SomeDate is “03/30/2004”, DateValue(SomeDate) returns March 30, 2004 as a DateTime value. Day( DATE_VALUE ) Returns the day part of the date argument as a numeric value from 1 to 31. If SomeDate is March 30, 2004, Day(SomeDate) returns 30. EDate( DATE_VALUE, NUMBER_OF_MONTHS ) Returns a date the specified number of months from the date argument. If NUMBER_OF_MONTHS is a positive value, a date after the specified date is returned; use a negative value to obtain a date before the specified date. If SomeDate is March 31, 2004, EDate(SomeDate, -1) returns February 29, 2004 and EDate(SomeDate, 1) returns April 30, 2004. Empty( VALUE ) Determines whether an expression evaluates to empty. If SomeText is “hello” and SomeOtherText is “”, Empty(SomeText) returns false and Empty(SomeOtherText) returns true. EndOfMonth( DATE_VALUE ) Returns the last day of the month the specified date is in. If SomeDate is February 15, 2009, EndOfMonth(SomeDate) returns February 28, 2009. Find( STRING_TO_FIND, STRING_TO_SEARCH_IN [, START_POSITION] ) Returns the position at which STRING_TO_FIND is found within STRING_TO_SEARCH_IN or -1 if it isn’t found. The position is zero-based, so Find returns 0 if STRING_TO_FIND is found at the start of STRING_TO_SEARCH_IN. The optional START_POSITION argument specifies the starting position to search from. Find is case-sensitive; use the Search function for case-insensitive searches. Find(“soft”, “Microsoft”) returns 5 and Find(“soft”, “MicroSoft”) returns -1 (because of the capital “S”). Find(“Micro”, “Microsoft”) returns 0 while Find(“mega”, “Microsoft”) returns -1. Find(“This is the best”, “is”) returns 2 (the “is” within “This”) while Find(“This is the best”, “is”, 4) returns 5 (the “is” word). FirstOfMonth( DATE_VALUE ) Return the first day of the month the specified date is in. If SomeDate is March 15, 2009, FirstOfMonth(SomeDate) returns March 1, 2009. Floor( NUMERIC_VALUE ) Returns the nearest integer that is less than or equal to the specified value. If SomeValue is 17.6, Floor(SomeValue) returns 17. GetConditionValue( CONDITION, VALUE ) Gets the value for the specified condition. The first parameter is the condition number (the first condition is 1, the second is 2, and so on) and the second is the value number (a condition may have more than one value, such as “is one of” or “is between;” the first value is 1, the second is 2, and so on). This function can only be used in the context of a report, such as in the report title, not in a formula. If the first filter condition for a report is Country equals (as-at-runtime) and the user chooses Germany when they run report, GetConditionValue(1, 1) returns Germany. GetConditionValue( VALUE ) Similar to the previous function but this one can only be used in the context of a filter condition, so it can be used, for example, in the custom description of a condition. If the filter condition is Country equals (as-at-runtime) and the user chooses Germany when they run report, GetConditionValue(1) returns Germany. GetParameter( NAME, CAPTION, TYPE, DEFAULT ) Prompts the user for a value of the specified data type. This is similar to the ask-at-runtime condition dialog except the value is used in the expression of a formula. If you call the function more than once with the same name, the user isn’t prompted again; instead, the value they enter the first time is returned. NAME is the name of the parameter and CAPTION is the caption displayed to the user. TYPE is the data type with quotes around it, such as “String” for a string, “DateTime” for a DateTime value, “Int32” for an integer, and “Decimal” for a numeric value. DEFAULT is the default value; use “” if there is no default. GetParameter(“FiscalYear”, “Current fiscal year”, “Int32”, “”) returns whatever value the user enters. GoMonth( DATE_VALUE, NUMBER_OF_MONTHS ) This function is the same as EDate and is provided for backward compatibility. Hour( DATE_VALUE ) Gives the hour portion of the specified DateTime value. If SomeDate is March 30, 2004 1:35 PM, Hour(SomeDate) is 13. ICase( EXPRESSION1, TRUE_RESULT1, EXPRESSION2, TRUE_RESULT2, …, FALSE_RESULT ) If EXPRESSION1 is True, ICase returns TRUE_RESULT1. If not and EXPRESSION2 is True, ICase returns TRUE_RESULT2. Up to five expression/true result pairs are allowed. If none of the expressions is true, ICase returns FALSE_RESULT. If SomeDate is March 30, 2004, ICase(Month(SomeDate) = 1, “January”, Month(SomeDate) = 2, “February”, Month(SomeDate) = 3, “March”, “Some Other Month”)) returns “March.” . If( EXPRESSION, TRUE_RESULT, FALSE_RESULT ) If EXPRESSION is True, If returns TRUE_RESULT. Otherwise, it returns FALSE_RESULT. If statements can be nested if necessary but ICase is more efficient and less to type. If SomeDate is March 30, 2004, If(Month(SomeDate) = 1, “January”, “Some Other Month”) returns “Some Other Month.” . IIf( EXPRESSION, TRUE_RESULT, FALSE_RESULT ) This function is the same as If and is provided for backward compatibility. InList( VALUE, LISTVALUE1, LISTVALUE2, LISTVALUE3 … ) Determines if a set of values contains the specified value. If MyField contains “C”, InList(MyField, “A”, “B”, “C”, “D”, “E”) returns true. Int( NUMERIC_VALUE ) Returns the integer portion of a numeric value, rounding up or down as necessary. If SomeValue is 17.6, Int(SomeValue) returns 18. ISNull( VALUE ) Returns true if the value contains null or false if not. If SomeValue is 17.6, ISNull(SomeValue) returns false. If SomeValue is null, ISNull(SomeValue) returns true. Left( STRING, NUM_CHARS ) Returns the specified number of characters from the argument, beginning at the first character on the left. Left(“Microsoft Windows”, 5) returns “Micro.” . Len( STRING ) Returns the number of characters in the argument. Len(“Microsoft Windows”) returns 17. Lower( STRING ) Converts a character string to lowercase. Lower(“Microsoft Windows”) returns “microsoft windows.” . LTrim( STRING ) Removes blanks and nulls from the beginning of the argument. LTrim(“     This is a test     ”) returns “This is a test     ” . LTrim( STRING, CHAR1, CHAR2, CHAR3 … ) Removes all instances of the specified characters from the beginning of the parameter. LTrim(“ 00   This is a test    ”, ‘ ’, ‘0’) returns “This is a test    ” . Match( VALUE, ARRAY ) Returns the position a value is found at in an array, or -1 if the value isn’t found. The value is zero-based, meaning the first element of the array is 0, the second is 1, and so forth. If MyArray is an array of 3, 5, 2, 1, 4, Match(5, MyArray) returns 1. Max( VALUE1, VALUE2, VALUE3, … ) Returns the largest of a set of values. Max(3, 4, 2, 5, -17) returns 5. Mid( STRING, START_POSITION [, NUM_CHARS] ) A subset of the string value, starting from START_POSITION (the first character is position 0, the second position 1, and so on). NUM_CHARS is optional: if it isn’t specified, all characters starting from START_POSITION to the end of the string are returned. If it is specified, NUM_CHARS starting from START_POSITION are returned. Mid(“Microsoft Windows”, 5) returns “soft Windows.” Mid(“Microsoft Windows”, 5, 4) returns “soft.” . Min( VALUE1, VALUE2, VALUE3, … ) Returns the smallest of a set of values. Min(3, 4, 2, 5, -17) returns -17. Month( DATE_VALUE ) Returns the month part of the date argument as a numeric value. If SomeDate is March 30, 2004, Month(SomeDate) returns 3. MonthName( DATE_VALUE ) Returns the month name of the date argument, localized to the language for your system. If SomeDate is March 30, 2004, MonthName(SomeDate) returns “March.” . Now() Returns the current date and time as a DateTime value. PadL( STRING, LENGTH [, CHAR] ) Returns a string, padded with spaces or characters on the left to a specified length. If SomeValue is “Windows,” PadL(SomeValue, 10) is “   Windows” and PadL(SomeValue, 10, ‘a’) is “aaaWindows.” . PadR( STRING, LENGTH [, CHAR] ) Returns a string, padded with spaces or characters on the right to a specified length. If SomeValue is “Windows,” PadR(SomeValue, 10) is “Windows   ” and PadR(SomeValue, 10, ‘a’) is “Windowsaaa.” . Proper( STRING ) Converts a character string to title case (the first letter of each word is capitalized). Proper(“microsoft windows”) returns “Microsoft Windows.” . Replace( OLD_TEXT, START, NUM_CHARS_TO_REPLACE, REPLACEMENT ) Returns a string created by replacing a specified number of characters in a string with another string. START specifies the position in OLD_TEXT where the replacement begins (remembering that the first character is 0, the second is 1, and so on), NUM_CHARS_TO_REPLACE specifies the number of characters to be replaced (if it’s 0, the replacement string is inserted into OLD_TEXT), and REPLACEMENT specifies the replacement string (if it’s the empty string, the number of characters specified by NUM_CHARS_TO_REPLACE are removed from OLD_TEXT). If SomeValue is “The quick brown fox”, Replace(SomeValue, 4, 5, “slow”) returns “The slow brown fox.” . Replicate( STRING, NUMBER_OF_TIMES ) This function is the same as Rept and is provided for backward compatibility. Rept( STRING, NUMBER_OF_TIMES ) Repeats the specified string the specified number of times. Rept(“The”, 5) returns “TheTheTheTheThe.” . Right( STRING, NUM_CHARS ) Returns the specified number of rightmost characters from a character string. Right(“Microsoft Windows”, 5) returns “ndows.” . Round( NUMERIC_VALUE, NUMBER_OF_DIGITS ) Returns a numeric value rounded to a specified number of decimal places. If SomeValue contains 17.567, Round(SomeValue, 2) returns 17.57. Search( STRING_TO_FIND, STRING_TO_SEARCH_IN [, START_POSITION] ) Returns the position at which STRING_TO_FIND is found within STRING_TO_SEARCH_IN or -1 if it isn’t found. The position is zero-based, so Search returns 0 if STRING_TO_FIND is found at the start of STRING_TO_SEARCH_IN. The optional START_POSITION argument specifies the starting position to search from. Search is case-insensitive; use the Find function for case-sensitive searches. Search(“soft”, “Microsoft”) and Search(“soft”, “MicroSoft”) both return 5 (the second example has a capital “S” but Search is case-insensitive). Search(“Micro”, “Microsoft”) returns 0 while Search(“mega”, “Microsoft”) returns -1. Search(“This is the best”, “is”) returns 2 (the “is” within “This”) while Search(“This is the best”, “is”, 4) returns 5 (the “is” word). Split( TEXT, SEPARATOR_CHARACTER, SUBSECTION_NUMBER ) This function splits up text into subsections by a defined separator character and returns the subsection corresponding to the passed-in subsection number. Str( VALUE ) This function is similar to Text and is provided for backward compatibility. StrTran( TEXT, FIND_VALUE, [, REPLACE_VALUE [, START_OCCURRENCE , NUM_OF_OCCURRENCES , FLAGS ]] ) Returns a string created by replacing one string within a string with another string. FIND_VALUE specifies the text to find within TEXT. REPLACE_VALUE is the string to replace FIND_VALUE with; if isn’t specified, FIND_VALUE is removed from TEXT. The START_OCCURRENCE and NUM_OF_OCCURRENCES arguments are ignored as they’re for backward compatibility only. Specify a non-zero value for FLAGS to perform a case-insensitive search. If SomeValue is “The quick brown fox”, StrTran(SomeValue, “quick”, “slow”) returns “The slow brown fox.” If SomeValue is “The quick brown fox”, StrTran(SomeValue, “QUICK”, “slow”, -1, -1, 1) returns “The slow brown fox.” . Stuff( OLD_TEXT, START, NUM_CHARS_TO_REPLACE, REPLACEMENT ) This function is the same as Replace and is provided for backward compatibility. Substitute( TEXT, FIND_VALUE, REPLACE_VALUE ) Searches the first argument for occurrences of the second and replaces each occurrence with the third. Specify an empty string to remove FIND_VALUE from TEXT. Substitute(“Microsoft Windows”, “Micro”, “Mega”) returns “Megasoft Windows.” . Substr( STRING, START_POSITION [, NUM_CHARS] ) This function is the same as Mid and is provided for backward compatibility. Text( VALUE [, FORMAT] ) Converts the argument into the equivalent string. This is the equivalent of cast(VALUE, String). If the optional FORMAT argument is specified, it indicates how to do the conversion; see the MSDN web site for the type of formats that can be specified. If SomeValue is 20, Text(SomeValue) returns “20” and Text(SomeValue, “There are {0} items”) returns “There are 20 items.” . ToDecimal( VALUE ) Converts a double value to a decimal value. This is usually needed in an expression when multiplying a literal value like 0.05 by a decimal value. Quantity * UnitPrice * ToDecimal(0.05) returns 5% of the product of Quantity and UnitPrice. ToDouble( VALUE ) Converts a decimal value to a double value. This is usually needed in an expression when multiplying a field containing double values by a decimal value. ToDouble(Quantity * UnitPrice) * 0.05 returns 5% of the product of Quantity and UnitPrice. Trim( STRING ) Removes all blanks and nulls from both the beginning and the end of the argument. Trim(“     This is a test     ”) returns “This is a test” . Upper( STRING ) Converts a character string to uppercase. Upper(“Microsoft Windows”) returns “MICROSOFT WINDOWS” . Val( STRING ) This function is the same as Value and is provided for backward compatibility. Value( STRING ) Converts a string value to a numeric value. If SomeString is “10”, Value(SomeString) returns 10 . Year( DATE_VALUE ) Returns the year part of the date argument as a numeric value. If SomeDate is March 30, 2004, Year(SomeDate) returns 2004 . ",
